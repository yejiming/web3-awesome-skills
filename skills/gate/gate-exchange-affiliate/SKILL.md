  - Codex: `gate-mcp-codex-installer`
  - Claude: `gate-mcp-claude-installer`
  - OpenClaw: `gate-mcp-openclaw-installer`

## Important Notice

- **Role**: This skill uses Partner APIs only. The term "affiliate" in user queries refers to Partner role.
- **Time Limit**: API supports maximum 30 days per request. For queries >30 days (up to 180 days), agent must split into multiple 30-day segments.
- **Authentication**: Requires `X-Gate-User-Id` header with partner privileges.
- **CRITICAL - user_id Parameter**: In both `commission_history` and `transaction_history` APIs, the `user_id` parameter filters by "trader/trading user" NOT "commission receiver". Only use this parameter when explicitly querying a specific trader's contribution. For general commission queries, DO NOT use user_id parameter.
- **Data Aggregation**: When calculating totals from API response lists, use custom aggregation logic based on business rules. DO NOT simply sum all values as this may lead to incorrect results due to data structure and business logic considerations.

### Query time and timezone (UTC+8)

All query windows use the user's **current calendar date** in **UTC+8**. For relative phrases ("last 7 days", "last 30 days", "this week", "last month"): compute the start date by subtracting the requested span from today, convert start and end to UTC+8 00:00:00 and 23:59:59 respectively, then to Unix timestamps. **NEVER** use future timestamps as query bounds. The `to` parameter must always be ≤ current Unix time. If the user specifies a future date, reject the query and explain that only historical data is available.

## Available APIs (Partner Only)

| API Endpoint | Description | Time Limit |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| `GET /rebate/partner/transaction_history` | Get referred users' trading records | ≤30 days per request |
| `GET /rebate/partner/commission_history` | Get referred users' commission records | ≤30 days per request |
| `GET /rebate/partner/sub_list` | Get subordinate list (for customer count) | No time parameter |
| `GET /rebate/partner/eligibility` | Check if user is eligible to apply for partner | No time parameter |
| `GET /rebate/partner/applications/recent` | Get user's recent partner application record (last 30 days) | No time parameter |

**Note**: Agency APIs (`/rebate/agency/*`) are deprecated and not used in this skill.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL API USAGE WARNINGS

### user_id Parameter Clarification
- **NEVER use `user_id` parameter for general commission queries**
- The `user_id` parameter in both `commission_history` and `transaction_history` APIs filters by **TRADER/TRADING USER**, not commission receiver
- Only use `user_id` when explicitly querying a specific trader's contribution (e.g., "UID 123456's trading volume")
- For queries like "my commission", "my earnings", "my rebate" - **DO NOT use user_id parameter**

### Data Aggregation Rules
- **DO NOT simply sum all values from API response lists**
- Use custom aggregation logic that considers:
  - Business rules and data relationships
  - Asset type grouping
  - Proper filtering and deduplication
  - Time period boundaries
- Raw summation may lead to incorrect results due to data structure complexities

## Safety Rules

- **Query times (UTC+8)**: Follow **Important Notice → Query time and timezone (UTC+8)** for relative ranges, day boundaries, and Unix conversion. Never use future timestamps; `to` must be ≤ current Unix time; reject user-specified future dates.
- **user_id usage**: Use the `user_id` parameter only when the user explicitly asks about a specific trader's contribution (e.g. "UID 123456's volume"). Do not use `user_id` for "my commission" or "my earnings"—those are the partner's own totals across all referred users.
- **Data scope**: Query only data for the authenticated partner. Do not attempt to access other partners' data or to infer data outside the API responses.
- **Aggregation**: Do not sum list fields blindly. Use documented aggregation rules and respect asset types, deduplication, and period boundaries to avoid incorrect totals.
- **Sub-accounts**: If the API indicates the account is a sub-account or returns a sub_account eligibility block, direct the user to use the main account for partner data or application.

## Core Metrics

1. **Commission Amount**: Total rebate earnings from `commission_history`
2. **Trading Volume**: Total trading amount from `transaction_history`
3. **Net Fees**: Total fees collected from `transaction_history`
4. **Customer Count**: Total subordinates from `sub_list`
5. **Trading Users**: Unique user count from `transaction_history`

## Domain Knowledge

- **Partner (affiliate)**: In this skill, "affiliate" and "partner" refer to the same role: a user who refers others to trade on Gate Exchange and earns rebate (commission) from referred users' trading activity. Only Partner APIs are used; Agency APIs are deprecated.
- **Commission (rebate)**: Commission is the rebate paid to the partner from trading fees generated by referred users. It is reported per transaction or per period via commission history. Amounts may be in different assets (e.g. USDT); aggregation must follow business rules and asset handling.
- **Trading volume and net fees**: These come from referred users' trading activity (spot, futures, etc.). Transaction history returns per-trade records; volume and fees must be aggregated with proper logic—do not naively sum list fields.
- **Subordinates**: Users referred by the partner. The subordinate list returns them with types: Sub-agent (1), Indirect customer (2), Direct customer (3). Customer count is the total number of subordinates; trading users is the count of unique users with trading activity in the requested period.
- **Eligibility**: Whether the current user can apply for the partner program. Checked via the eligibility API; the response includes `eligible` and, when not eligible, `block_reasons` and `block_reason_codes` (e.g. sub_account, already_agent, kyc_incomplete).
- **Application status**: The user's recent partner application (if any) within the last 30 days, including audit status (pending / approved / rejected), returned by the applications/recent API.

## Workflow
### Step 1: Parse User Query

Identify the query type and extract parameters.

Key data to extract:
- `query_type`: overview | time_specific | metric_specific | user_specific | team_report | application | application_eligibility | application_status
- `time_range`: default 7 days or user-specified period
- `metric`: commission | volume | fees | customers | trading_users (if metric-specific)
- `user_id`: specific user ID (if user-specific query)

### Step 2: Validate Time Range

Check if the requested time range is valid and determine if splitting is needed.

Key data to extract:
- `needs_splitting`: boolean (true if >30 days)
- `segments`: array of time segments if splitting needed
- `error`: string if time range >180 days

### Step 3: Call Partner APIs

Based on query type, call the appropriate Partner APIs.

When MCP is configured with Gate rebate tools, call the corresponding MCP tools by name (e.g. Call `cex_rebate_partner_transaction_history`, Call `cex_rebate_partner_commissions_history`, Call `cex_rebate_partner_sub_list`, Call `cex_rebate_get_partner_eligibility`, Call `cex_rebate_get_partner_application_recent`) with the parameters described in API Parameter Reference. When MCP is not available, use the API paths below.

**CRITICAL REMINDER**: 
- DO NOT use `user_id` parameter unless explicitly querying a specific trader's contribution
- The `user_id` in API responses represents the TRADER, not the commission receiver
- For "my commission" queries, omit the user_id parameter entirely

For overview or time-specific queries:
- Call `/rebate/partner/transaction_history` with time parameters (NO user_id)
- Call `/rebate/partner/commission_history` with time parameters (NO user_id)
- Call `/rebate/partner/sub_list` for customer count

For metric-specific queries:
- Call only the required API(s) based on the metric (NO user_id unless specified)

For user-specific queries:
- Call APIs with `user_id` parameter (this shows that specific trader's contribution)

For application-related queries:
- "Can I apply?" / "Am I eligible?" → Call `GET /rebate/partner/eligibility` (returns eligible, block_reasons, block_reason_codes)
- "My application status" / "Recent application" / "Application result" → Call `GET /rebate/partner/applications/recent` (returns last 30 days application record with audit_status, apply_msg, etc.)
- Generic "how to apply" → Optionally call eligibility first, then return application steps and portal link

Key data to extract:
- `transactions`: array of trading records
- `commissions`: array of commission records
- `subordinates`: array of team members
- `total_count`: total records for pagination
- `eligibility`: { eligible, block_reasons, block_reason_codes } (for application_eligibility)
- `application_recent`: application record or empty (for application_status)

### Step 4: Handle Pagination

If `total > limit`, implement pagination to retrieve all data.

Key data to extract:
- `all_data`: complete dataset after pagination
- `pages_fetched`: number of API calls made

### Step 5: Aggregate Data

Calculate the requested metrics from the raw API responses.

**IMPORTANT**: Use custom aggregation logic based on business rules. DO NOT simply sum all values.
- Consider data relationships and business logic
- Handle different asset types appropriately
- Apply proper grouping and filtering rules

Key data to extract:
- `commission_amount`: aggregated commission amount with proper business logic
- `trading_volume`: aggregated trading amount with proper calculations
- `net_fees`: aggregated fees with appropriate rules
- `customer_count`: total from sub_list
- `trading_users`: count of unique user_ids

### Step 6: Format Response

Generate the appropriate response based on query type using the templates.

## Usage Scenarios

### Case 1: Overview Query (No Time Specified)

**Triggers**: "my affiliate data", "show my partner stats", "affiliate dashboard"

**Default**: Last 7 days

**Output Template**:
```
Your affiliate data overview (last 7 days):
- Commission Amount: XXX USDT
- Trading Volume: XXX USDT
- Net Fees: XXX USDT
- Customer Count: XXX
- Trading Users: XXX

For detailed data, visit the affiliate dashboard: {dashboard_url}
```

### Case 2: Time-Specific Query

**Triggers**: "commission this week", "last month's rebate", "earnings for March"

**Time Handling**:
- All times are calculated based on user's system current date in UTC+8 timezone
- Convert date ranges to UTC+8 00:00:00 (start) and 23:59:59 (end), then to Unix timestamps
- If ≤30 days: Single API call
- If >30 days and ≤180 days: Split into multiple 30-day segments
- If >180 days: Return error "Only supports queries within last 180 days"

**Agent Splitting Logic** (for >30 days):
```
Example: User requests 60 days (2026-01-01 to 2026-03-01 in UTC+8)
Convert to UTC+8 00:00:00 and 23:59:59, then to Unix timestamps:
1. 2026-01-01 00:00:00 UTC+8 to 2026-01-31 23:59:59 UTC+8 (31 days -> adjust to 30)
2. 2026-01-31 00:00:00 UTC+8 to 2026-03-01 23:59:59 UTC+8 (29 days)
Call each segment separately with converted timestamps, then merge results.
```

**Output Template**:
```
Your affiliate data for {time_range}:
- Commission Amount: XXX USDT
- Trading Volume: XXX USDT
- Net Fees: XXX USDT
- Customer Count: XXX
- Trading Users: XXX
```

### Case 3: Metric-Specific Query

**Triggers**: 
- Commission: "my rebate income", "commission earnings", "how much commission"
- Volume: "team trading volume", "total volume"
- Fees: "net fees collected", "fee contribution"
- Customers: "customer count", "team size", "how many referrals"
- Trading Users: "active traders", "how many users trading"

**Output Template**:
```
Your {metric_name} for the last 7 days: XXX {unit}

For detailed data, visit the affiliate dashboard: {dashboard_url}
```

### Case 4: User-Specific Contribution

**Triggers**: "UID 123456 contribution", "user 123456 trading volume", "how much commission from 123456"

**IMPORTANT**: The user_id parameter filters by "trader" not "commission receiver". This shows the trading activity and commission generated BY that specific trader, not commissions received by them.

**Parameters**: 
- Required: `user_id` (the trader's UID whose contribution you want to check)
- Optional: time range (default last 7 days)

**Output Template**:
```
UID {user_id} contribution (last 7 days):
- Commission Amount: XXX USDT (commission generated from this trader's activity)
- Trading Volume: XXX USDT (this trader's trading volume)
- Fees: XXX USDT (fees from this trader's trades)
```

### Case 5: Team Performance Report

**Triggers**: "team performance", "affiliate report", "partner analytics"

**Process**:
1. Call `sub_list` to get team members
2. Call `transaction_history` for trading data
3. Call `commission_history` for commission data
4. Aggregate and analyze

**Output Template**:
```
=== Team Performance Report ({time_range}) ===

📊 Team Overview
- Total Members: XXX (Sub-agents: X, Direct: X, Indirect: X)
- Active Users: XXX (XX.X%)
- New Members: XXX

- Futures Commission: XXX.XX USDT (XX%)

👑 Top 5 Contributors
1. UID XXXXX - Volume XXX,XXX USDT / Commission XX.X USDT
2. ...
```

### Case 6: Affiliate Application Guidance

**Triggers**: "apply for affiliate", "become a partner", "join affiliate program", "can I apply?", "am I eligible?", "my application status", "recent application", "application result"

**When to call APIs**:
- User asks "can I apply?" or "am I eligible?" → Call `GET /rebate/partner/eligibility`. If eligible, return application steps; if not, return block_reasons and guidance.
- User asks "my application status" or "recent application" → Call `GET /rebate/partner/applications/recent`. Return audit_status (0=pending, 1=approved, 2=rejected), apply_msg, and jump_url.
- User only asks "how to apply" → Optionally call eligibility first, then return steps and portal.

**Eligibility response template** (after calling eligibility API):
```
Eligibility check: {eligible ? "You are eligible to apply." : "You are not eligible at this time."}
{If not eligible:}
Block reasons: {block_reasons}

## Pagination Strategy

For complete data retrieval when total > limit:
```python
offset = 0
all_data = []
while True:
    result = call_api(limit=100, offset=offset)
    all_data.extend(result['list'])
    if len(result['list']) < 100 or offset + 100 >= result['total']:
        break
    offset += 100

# IMPORTANT: Apply custom aggregation logic after collecting all data
# DO NOT simply sum values - consider business rules and data relationships
```

## Time Handling

- API accepts Unix timestamps in seconds (not milliseconds)
- **⚠️ CRITICAL TIME CALCULATION RULES**:
  - All query times are calculated based on the user's system current date (UTC+8 timezone)
  - For any relative time description ("last 7 days", "last 30 days", "this week", "last month", etc.):
    1. Get current system date in UTC+8 timezone
    2. Calculate the start date by subtracting the requested days from current date
    3. Convert both dates to UTC+8 00:00:00 (start of day) and 23:59:59 (end of day)
    4. Convert these UTC+8 times to Unix timestamps
    5. Use these timestamps for API calls
  - **NEVER use future timestamps as query conditions**
  - The `to` parameter must always be ≤ current Unix timestamp
  - If user specifies a future date, reject the query and explain only historical data is available

- **Time Conversion Examples** (assuming current date is 2026-03-13 in UTC+8):
  - "last 7 days" query:
    - Start date: 2026-03-07 (7 days ago)
    - from: 2026-03-07 00:00:00 UTC+8 → Unix timestamp
    - to: 2026-03-13 23:59:59 UTC+8 → Unix timestamp
  - "last 30 days" query:
    - Start date: 2026-02-12 (30 days ago)
    - from: 2026-02-12 00:00:00 UTC+8 → Unix timestamp
    - to: 2026-03-13 23:59:59 UTC+8 → Unix timestamp
  - "this week" query (assuming week starts Monday):
    - Start date: 2026-03-09 (Monday of current week)
    - from: 2026-03-09 00:00:00 UTC+8 → Unix timestamp
    - to: 2026-03-13 23:59:59 UTC+8 → Unix timestamp

- Maximum 30 days per API request, split if needed

## Amount Formatting

- Convert string amounts to numbers for calculation
- Display with appropriate precision (USDT: 2 decimals, BTC: 8 decimals)
- Add thousand separators for large numbers
