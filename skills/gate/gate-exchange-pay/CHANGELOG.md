# Changelog

## [2026.3.27-2] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed

- SKILL.md: H1 aligned with skill id (`gate-exchange-pay — Gate Pay payment`, gate-skill-cr 6.7). Clarified Step 2 vs Step 1 (optional display does not replace payment-intent gate). Added concise **Risk of loss** bullet alongside existing irreversibility and disclaimers.
- `references/scenarios.md`: Scenario 1 **Expected Behavior** now parameterizes `order_id` / `amount` / `currency` across all three prompt shapes; added document-level **Scenario layout** note for **Unexpected Behavior** placement.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: **Compliance** note under `2026.3.26-1` corrected so it no longer implies H1/General Rules adjacency was true before `2026.3.27-1`.

## [2026.3.27-1] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed

- SKILL.md: `## General Rules` now immediately follows the H1 heading; introductory prose moved to `## Scope and audience` (gate-skill-cr Step 9.2).
- `references/scenarios.md`: Prompt Examples use English-only lines; Chinese receipts remain inside fenced code blocks. Context clarifies that live user wording may be non-English (gate-skill-cr Step 2.2–2.5).
- Compliance notes: reworded brand bullet to avoid spelling deprecated brand forms.
- Removed redundant `skills/gate-exchange-pay.zip` (duplicate of the skill directory; lowers bundle noise).
- Added `## Scenarios` pointer to `references/scenarios.md` in SKILL.md.

## [2026.3.26-1] - 2026-03-26
