**Expected Behavior**:
1. Call `cex_earn_list_earn_fixed_term_products` (gate-d-e) with **status=2 (subscribing)** and **show_status=2 (visible)**; only return products that are subscribable and visible. Paginate with `page` and `limit` as needed, and default `limit` to `10` when omitted.
2. Output: Query submitted! The Fixed Earn product list is as follows: then a table in the following format.

**Output table format**: use the table title **"Fixed Earn products"** and the following column order (consistent with the frontend):

| Currency | pid | Term (days) | Product type | Current base APY | Minimum subscription | Subscription limit | Remaining available amount | Early redemption supported | Auto-compounding supported | Maturity rollover supported |
|------|-----|----------|----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|

**Prompt Examples**:
- "Please check which Fixed Earn products are available for USDT" / "Which fixed-term products can I subscribe to with USDT?"

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Extract asset (e.g. USDT) from user input; if missing, ask.
2. Call `cex_earn_list_earn_fixed_term_products_by_asset` (gate-d-e) with `asset`; if the API supports it, pass **status=2** and **show_status=2** and only return subscribing and visible products.
3. If the asset-scoped response does not include `Minimum subscription`, `Subscription limit`, `Remaining available amount`, or `Maturity rollover supported`, call the full product list with the same `asset` plus `status=2` and `show_status=2`, then use the matching product row to fill those fields.
4. Output: Query submitted! The Fixed Earn USDT product list is as follows: then the same table structure as Scenario 1.

**MCP** (see `fixed-earn-mcp-tools.md` §2): **cex_earn_list_earn_fixed_term_products_by_asset**

**Prompt Examples**:
- "Subscribe 100 USDT to Fixed Earn for 7 days" / "Buy 0.01 BTC Fixed Earn for 30 days"

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Extract or ask for the currency, amount, and term (e.g. 7 days); resolve to `product_id` (e.g. via the product list by asset + lock_up_period). **Only use products with status=2 (subscribing).**

2. Output: Query submitted! Your current Fixed Earn positions are as follows: then render the screenshot-style table below.

**Output table format** (Fixed Earn total positions, screenshot style):

| order_id | Underlying currency | Holding term (days) | Product type | Current base APY | Estimated maturity yield | Subscription time (UTC+0) | Maturity time (UTC+0) | Remaining days | Early redemption supported | Auto-compounding supported | Maturity rollover supported |
|----------|----------|------------------|----------|--------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Extract or ask: `order_id`.
2. Call `cex_earn_list_earn_fixed_term_lends` (gate-d-e) with `order_type: "1"`, `order_id`, `page`, `limit`.
3. Output: Query submitted! Your Fixed Earn position {order_id} is as follows: then render the same screenshot-style table, using the Scenario 5 column layout for the matching order.

**MCP** (see `fixed-earn-mcp-tools.md` §4): **cex_earn_list_earn_fixed_term_lends**

---

## Scenario 7: Fixed-term history (Fixed Earn history records query)

**Context**: User asks for fixed-term wealth management history in a time range (subscribe / redeem / interest). Obtain user's history for the period; subscribe/redeem/interest.

**Prompt Examples**:
- "Please check the last 3 months of fixed-term subscription records"
- "Fixed-term redemption order records from 2025/1/1 to 2025/12/31"
- "Please check the last month of fixed-term interest records"

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Parse or ask time range (e.g. last 3 months, or start_at/end_at). Query the Fixed Earn transaction history via MCP; paginate or merge types as needed.
2. Call `cex_earn_list_earn_fixed_term_history` with `type` (1=subscribe, 2=redeem, 3=interest, 4=extra bonus) and optionally `start_at`, `end_at`; may call multiple types and merge, or paginate.
3. Output: **Query submitted! The Fixed Earn records are as follows** (if querying by time range, append "{start time} to {end time}"), then a table in the following format.

**Output table format** (Fixed Earn records; subscribe/redeem/interest/extra bonus all use this table):

| order_id | Operation time | Operation type | Underlying currency | Amount | Term (days) |
|----------|--------------|----------|--------------|------|--------------|
| 123445 | 2025-01-01 00:00 | subscribe | USDT | 100.123 | 7 |
| 123445 | 2025-01-01 00:00 | redeem | USDT | 100.123 | 30 |
| 123445 | 2025-01-01 00:00 | interest | USDT | 0.8 | 30 |

- **Operation type**：subscribe(type=1) / redeem(type=2) / interest(type=3) / extra bonus(type=4)。
- **Amount**: corresponds to the interface field **amount** (principal for subscribe/redeem, interest amount for interest).
- **Term (days)**: corresponds to `lock_up_period`. The last N fixed-term subscribe/redeem/interest records all use the 6 columns above.

**API response fields → table columns**:

| Table column | API field | Description |
|--------|----------|------|
| order_id | **order_id** | Order ID, use the API `order_id` field; fall back to `id` if it is not returned |
| Operation time | create_time | `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` |
| Operation type | type | 1 subscribe / 2 redeem / 3 interest / 4 extra bonus |
| Underlying currency | asset | Currency |
| Amount | **amount** | principal for subscribe/redeem, interest amount for interest |
| Term (days) | **lock_up_period** | Term (days) |

**MCP** (see `fixed-earn-mcp-tools.md` §6): **cex_earn_list_earn_fixed_term_history**

---

## Scenario 8: Compliance / region restriction (region-based order restrictions)

**Context**: User asks whether they can subscribe in their region or which regions are supported. Fixed Earn has region restrictions; subscription may be blocked for restricted regions.

**Prompt Examples**:
- "Can I subscribe in {region}?" / "Which regions does Fixed Earn support?"

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Do not perform subscribe; if user attempts subscribe in a restricted region, the create-order API will return a compliance error.
2. Return the standard compliance error message to the user.

**Output**: (return the specific error code information) Due to compliance restrictions, your region is not currently supported.

---

## Scenario 9: Compliance check failure (compliance validation failure)

**Context**: User reports that subscription failed with a compliance/region check error. Explain and return the same error message.

**Prompt Examples**:
- "Why does the compliance check fail?" / "My Fixed Earn subscription failed and it says compliance validation did not pass."

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Do not retry or expose internal logic; return the API error code/message when available.
2. Output the standard compliance message.

**Output**: (return the specific error code information) Due to compliance restrictions, your region is not currently supported.
