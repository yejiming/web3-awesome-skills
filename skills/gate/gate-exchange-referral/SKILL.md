### Product Definitions

#### 1. Earn Together

- **Definition**: A limited-time invitation campaign (viral mechanism) where the inviter (M1) shares an exclusive link, the invitee (M2) registers via the link and completes tasks, and both parties receive random token rewards
- **Activity Characteristics**:
  - Time-limited: Each campaign has a clear start and end date
  - Exclusive: Only one Earn Together campaign runs at a time
  - Random rewards: Reward amounts are randomly generated within a configured range
- **How to Participate**:
  1. Inviter (M1) shares an exclusive link
  2. Invitee (M2) registers via the link
  3. M2 completes designated tasks (KYC, deposit, trading)
  4. Both parties receive random cash vouchers
- **Important Notes**:
  - Specific task requirements (deposit amount, trading volume) vary by region; please check the activity page for details
  - Rewards are subject to risk-control review and are typically distributed within 14 business days after claiming

#### 2. Help & Get Coupons

- **Definition**: Invite 2 friends to complete tasks and receive platform coupon rewards; suitable for users who want trial vouchers or discount coupons
- **How to Participate**:
  1. Share your exclusive invitation link
  2. Invite 2 new users to register
  3. New users complete the following tasks: deposit task, trading task
  4. Receive coupon rewards (e.g., 200 USDT position trial voucher; rewards may be adjusted based on actual conditions)
- **Important Notes**:

#### 3. Super Commission

  3. Friends trade (Spot, Alpha, Futures, TradFi, etc.)
  4. Both you and your friends receive trading fee rebates
- **Important Notes**:
  - Commission rates vary by trading type; please check the activity page for detailed rebate rules

### Activity Constraints

- All three activities can be joined simultaneously; Earn Together is a time-limited event that opens irregularly
- Each invitee can only be invited through one invitation mode
- Referral relationships created through Super Commission cannot earn rewards from other activities; users invited through other activities cannot earn commission rebates

### Common Misconceptions

| User Question | Correct Answer |
|---------|---------|
| "Why did my friend and I receive different amounts?" | Rewards are randomly generated; the amount may differ for each invitation |
| "Are rewards credited immediately?" | Rewards are subject to risk-control review and are typically reviewed and distributed within 14 business days after the activity ends |
| "What are the specific task requirements? How much to deposit? How much to trade?" | Specific deposit amounts and trading volume requirements vary by regional policy; please check the activity page for details |

## Workflow

When the user asks any question related to inviting friends, follow this sequence.

### Step 1: Identify Intent Type

Classify the request into one of the following categories:
1. Activity recommendation (user wants to know what referral activities are available)
2. Rule interpretation (user wants to understand a specific activity's rules/mechanics)
3. Activity selection advice (user has a specific need and wants the best-matching activity recommended)
4. FAQ (reward arrival time, amount differences, task requirements, etc.)
5. Data query (user wants to view activity data or reward progress)
6. Multi-activity participation rules (user wants to join multiple activities simultaneously)

### Step 2: Check Activity Status

For activity recommendation requests:
- Check whether there is an active Earn Together campaign
  - If yes → Prioritize recommending Earn Together (1 activity)
  - If no → Recommend Help & Get Coupons + Super Commission

Select the corresponding response strategy based on the Case Routing Map.

### Step 4: Return Result

The response must include:
- Activity name and brief description
- Core participation steps (simplified version)
- Key notes and caveats
- Guide the user to the activity page with the direct URL (https://www.gate.com/referral) for details (if applicable)
