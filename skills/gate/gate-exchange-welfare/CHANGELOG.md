## [2026.3.19-3] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- SKILL.md Routing Rules: Added wiki Case2 original trigger phrase "how to claim new user rewards" to line 2.
- SKILL.md Step 1: Removed "(registration time, whether completed any trades, etc.)" — this description was self-inferred, wiki did not define new/existing user determination criteria.
- SKILL.md Safety Rule 4: Changed disclaimer text from "subject to actual receipt, final interpretation rights belong to Gate" to wiki-specified "Non-agent, non-institutional users and users with normal account status can complete tasks and claim rewards", consistent with response template.
- SKILL.md: Restored "Cross-Skill Integration" section (accidentally deleted when removing "Scope Description" last time).

---

## [2026.3.19-2] - 2026-03-19

### Removed

- SKILL.md: Removed "Scope Description (version 3/19)" descriptions of future version planned scenarios (claim individual tasks, complete individual tasks, claim task rewards), aligned with latest wiki documentation — these sub-scenarios have been removed from requirements document and are no longer kept as planned items.
- README.md: Removed "Currently Not Supported" list from Scope, corresponding to above.
