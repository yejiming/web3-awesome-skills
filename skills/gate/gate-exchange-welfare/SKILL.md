## Routing Rules

| User Intent | Keywords / Patterns | Routing |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| Query welfare / rewards / tasks (general) | "what welfare", "how to claim rewards", "what tasks can I do", "welfare", "rewards" | Execute this Skill → Determine user type first |
| Query new user benefits / rewards | "new user benefits", "how to claim new user rewards", "new user tasks", "new user benefits", "newbie rewards" | Execute this Skill → Determine user type first |
| Spot trading | "buy BTC", "sell ETH" | Route to `gate-exchange-spot` |
| Asset query | "how much USDT do I have", "check balance" | Route to `gate-exchange-assets` |
| Deposit | "how to deposit", "how to fund account" | Route to deposit related Skill |

---

## Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Determine User Identity

Call MCP tool to query whether the current user is a new user.

| Step | MCP Tool | Parameters | Data Retrieved |
|------|----------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | `cex_welfare_get_user_identity` (User identity determination interface) | Automatically get current user identity | Returns code=0 (qualifies as new user) or error codes (1001=existing user, 1002=risk control, 1003=sub-account, 1004=agent, 1005=market maker, 1006=enterprise, 1008=not logged in) |

Enter corresponding branch based on returned result:
- **code=0 (new user)** → Execute [Case 2: New User Task List](#case-2-new-user-task-list)
- **code=1001 (existing user)** → Execute [Case 1: Existing User Guidance](#case-1-existing-user-guidance)
- **Other error codes** → Execute corresponding handling logic according to [Exception Handling](#exception-handling) section

---

### Case 1: Existing User Guidance

**Trigger Condition**: Step 1 determines user as existing user (`cex_welfare_get_user_identity` returns code=1001).

**No additional MCP tool calls needed**, directly output guidance text.

**Output Template**:

```
Please visit Gate web at https://www.gate.com/rewards_hub or open Gate App to view welfare tasks and rewards.
```

---

### Case 2: New User Task List

**Trigger Condition**: Step 1 determines user as new user (`cex_welfare_get_user_identity` returns code=0).

#### Step 2: Get All New User Onboarding Tasks

| Step | MCP Tool | Parameters | Data Retrieved |
|------|----------|------------|----------------|
| 2 | `cex_welfare_get_beginner_task_list` (Query beginner guidance task list) | Automatically get current user tasks | Get beginner guidance task list, including registration tasks (type=10) and guidance tasks (type=11), each task contains reward information, completion status and task description |

#### Step 3: Generate Task List Response

**Important Note**: Must use real task data obtained from MCP interface in Step 2, absolutely cannot fabricate or use template example data!

Based on the real task data returned from Step 2, output to users in the following format:

1. **Iterate through all tasks**: For each task in the `data.tasks` array returned by `cex_welfare_get_beginner_task_list`
2. **Extract real fields**: Use the task's real fields such as `task_name`, `task_desc`, `reward_num`, `reward_unit`, `status`
3. **Status display**: `status=1` shows "Pending", `status=2` shows "Completed"
4. **Format output**: Strictly follow template format, but content must be real MCP data

**Data mapping rules**:
- Task title: Use `task_name` field
- Task description: Use `task_desc` field  
- Reward amount: Use `reward_num` field
- Reward unit: Use `reward_unit` field
- Completion status: Use `status` field (1=Pending, 2=Completed)

## Safety Rules

1. **Read-only queries**: This Skill only queries task information, does not execute task claiming, reward distribution or other write operations.
2. **Identity verification prerequisite**: Must complete user type determination first, must not show new user task list to existing users.
3. **Real data only**: **Strictly prohibit fabricating task information!** Must use real data returned by MCP interface, must not use fake reward information from example templates (such as "10 points", "5 USDT trial voucher", etc.).
4. **Data integrity**: All displayed task names, descriptions, reward amounts, reward units must come from real return values of `cex_welfare_get_beginner_task_list` interface.
5. **Disclaimer**: Task information is subject to final display on Gate official website, data returned by this Skill is for reference only.
6. **Required prompt text**: When displaying task rewards, must include the required prompt text as specified: "Non-agent, non-institutional users and users with normal account status can complete tasks and claim rewards. Specific tasks and rewards are subject to final display on Gate official website/App", must not be omitted.
