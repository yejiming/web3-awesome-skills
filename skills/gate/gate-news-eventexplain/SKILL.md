description: "Event attribution and explanation. Use this skill ONLY when the user's query is exclusively about the reason behind a price move with no other analysis dimensions. Trigger phrases: why did X crash, what just happened, why is it pumping, what caused. If the query ALSO mentions fundamentals, risk check, technicals, or any other analysis dimension, use gate-info-research instead — it handles multi-dimension queries in a single unified report."

# gate-news-eventexplain

## General Rules

⚠️ STOP — You MUST read and strictly follow the shared runtime rules before proceeding.
Do NOT select or call any tool until all rules are read. These rules have the highest priority.
→ Read [gate-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/gate-runtime-rules.md)
→ Also read [info-news-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/info-news-runtime-rules.md) for **gate-info** / **gate-news**-specific rules (tool degradation, report standards, security, routing degradation, and per-skill version checks when `scripts/` is present).
- **Only call MCP tools explicitly listed in this skill.** Tools not documented here must NOT be called, even if they
  exist in the MCP server.

> The "Why is it pumping/dumping?" Skill. When the market experiences abnormal volatility and the user asks why, the system traces the event source through multi-step calls, cross-references market data to verify impact magnitude, and delivers a complete "Event → Impact Chain → Market Reaction" analysis report.

**Trigger Scenarios**: User expresses curiosity about a market anomaly, e.g., "why did BTC crash", "what just happened", "why did ETH suddenly spike".

**Per-skill updates:** This directory includes `scripts/update-skill.sh` and `scripts/update-skill.ps1`. Policy: [info-news-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/info-news-runtime-rules.md) §1. The **Trigger update** steps below apply in addition to [gate-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/gate-runtime-rules.md); when scripts are present, use this flow for version checks before execution.

---

## Trigger update (with Execution)

**Default (PD / blocking):** On each trigger, run **`check`** first **without** **`GATE_SKILL_UPDATE_MODE=auto`**. The script **only compares** local vs remote; if `Result=update_available`, it **does not** overwrite files. **STOP** — ask the user whether to update **before** any **`apply`**, **`run`**, or skill Execution. In sandboxes (e.g. Cursor), use **full / all permissions** when later running **`apply`**. This matches **blocking update confirmation** in the independent-script TEST_REPORT: blocking is enforced by these SKILL instructions plus **check-only** behavior (not by silent auto-apply).

**Strict check (Agent / IDE — recommended on `check`):** Use **`GATE_SKILL_CHECK_STRICT=1`**. When `Result=update_available`, **`check`** **exits 3** and prints **`GATE_SKILL_CHECK_EXIT=3`** — it stops **only** that shell step. **Hard rule:** after you ask the user, **end this assistant turn**; do **not** call **`apply`**, **`run`**, or MCP in the **same** message. **`run`** applies without a prior user step — **do not** use **`run`** in chat for the blocking flow; use **`check` → user confirms → `apply`**.

### Step 1 — Check

**Install root:** `check` / `apply` read **`$DEST/SKILL.md`**. Typical **`$SKILL_ROOT`**: **`$HOME/.cursor/skills/<name>/`**, **`$HOME/.codex/skills/<name>/`**, **`$HOME/.openclaw/skills/<name>/`**, **`$HOME/.agents/skills/<name>/`**, **`$HOME/.gemini/antigravity/skills/<name>/`**. Single-arg: the script resolves **`DEST`** in that order when **`SKILL.md`** exists; otherwise **`DEST`** is `scripts/../`. Workspace-only trees need two-arg **`check`** / **`apply`** with explicit **`DEST`**.

**Bash** (blocking — no auto; example Cursor):

```bash
GATE_SKILL_CHECK_STRICT=1 bash "$HOME/.cursor/skills/gate-news-eventexplain/scripts/update-skill.sh" check "gate-news-eventexplain"
```

**PowerShell:**

```powershell
$env:GATE_SKILL_CHECK_STRICT = '1'
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.cursor\skills\gate-news-eventexplain\scripts\update-skill.ps1" check "gate-news-eventexplain"
```

**Result semantics:** `skipped` = no action. `update_available` = remote newer; **with blocking flow, do not apply until the user agrees**. `check_failed` = could not compare — proceed with current version per [info-news-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/info-news-runtime-rules.md).

**Agent parse (stdout):** `GATE_SKILL_UPDATE_AGENT_ACTION=…`. **`BLOCK_UNTIL_USER_CONFIRMS_UPDATE`** → Step 2 before Execution. **`CONTINUE_SKILL_EXECUTION`** → no block from the check script.

### Step 2 — Confirm or Reject (blocking)

**If `update_available`:**

1. **STOP** — do NOT proceed to Execution yet.
2. Inform the user (e.g. newer version available; summarize if helpful).
3. **Wait for the user’s reply** — blocking step.

   **Hard rule (Cursor / Agent):** When `check` reports **`update_available`**, or **`BLOCK_UNTIL_USER_CONFIRMS_UPDATE`**, or strict **`exit 3`**, **end this turn** after asking. **Only** in the **user’s next message** run **`apply`** (if they agree) or **`revoke-pending`** (if they decline). Do **not** chain **`apply`** in the same turn as **`check`** for this flow.

   - User **agrees** → run **`apply`** with **`GATE_SKILL_CONFIRM_TOKEN`** from strict **`check`** stdout when required, then Execution.
   - User **declines** → **`revoke-pending`**, then Execution on the current install.

**Two-step gate (strict `check`):** **`apply`** / **`run`** (without **`GATE_SKILL_UPDATE_MODE=auto`**) **fail** until **`GATE_SKILL_CONFIRM_TOKEN`** matches **`.gate-skill-apply-token`**. User decline → **`revoke-pending`**.

```bash
GATE_SKILL_CONFIRM_TOKEN="<paste from check stdout>" bash "$HOME/.cursor/skills/gate-news-eventexplain/scripts/update-skill.sh" apply "gate-news-eventexplain"
```

```bash
bash "$HOME/.cursor/skills/gate-news-eventexplain/scripts/update-skill.sh" revoke-pending "gate-news-eventexplain"
```

```powershell
$env:GATE_SKILL_CONFIRM_TOKEN = '<paste from check stdout>'
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.cursor\skills\gate-news-eventexplain\scripts\update-skill.ps1" apply "gate-news-eventexplain"
```

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.cursor\skills\gate-news-eventexplain\scripts\update-skill.ps1" revoke-pending "gate-news-eventexplain"
```

**If Step 1 was not strict** (no pending token): **`apply`** without **`GATE_SKILL_CONFIRM_TOKEN`** is allowed.

**If `skipped` or `check_failed`:** no update step; proceed to Execution.

### Optional — `GATE_SKILL_UPDATE_MODE=auto`

For **CI / unattended automation only**: setting **`GATE_SKILL_UPDATE_MODE=auto`** on **`check`** makes the script **apply immediately** when the remote is newer — **no** user confirmation and **incompatible** with **blocking update confirmation** tests. Do **not** use **`auto`** on **`check`** when reproducing the blocking PD flow.

### Parameters

- **name**: Frontmatter `name` above; must match `skills/<name>/` on gate-skills.
- **Invoke**: Use **`$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/update-skill.sh`** (or `.ps1`) where **`$SKILL_ROOT/SKILL.md`** is this skill — e.g. **`~/.cursor/skills/<name>`**, **`~/.codex/skills/<name>`**, **`~/.openclaw/skills/<name>`**, **`~/.agents/skills/<name>`**, **`~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/<name>`**; do not treat **`~/.cursor`** (or any host root without **`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`**) as the install. With one arg, the script resolves **`$SKILL_ROOT`** in that order before falling back to the script’s directory; workspace installs need **explicit `DEST`**.

**Do not** dump raw script logs into the user-facing reply except when debugging. On **`check` exit 3** (strict), do not run Execution until Step 2 is resolved. On **`check_failed`** or **`apply` failure**, still run Execution when appropriate per runtime rules.

| Technical analysis | "BTC technical analysis" | Route to `gate-info-trendanalysis` |
| Market overview | "how's the market" | Route to `gate-info-marketoverview` |

---

## Execution Workflow

### Step 0: Multi-Dimension Intent Check

Before executing this Skill, check if the user's query involves multiple analysis dimensions:

- If the query is exclusively about the reason behind a price move, proceed with this Skill.
- If the query **also** mentions fundamentals, risk check, technicals, comparison, or any other analysis dimension beyond event attribution, route to `gate-info-research` — it handles multi-dimension queries with unified tool deduplication and coherent report aggregation.

### Step 1: Intent Recognition & Parameter Extraction

Extract from user input:
- `coin`: The coin involved (e.g., BTC, ETH; may be empty = overall market)
- `direction`: Up or down (aids search)
- `time_hint`: Time clue ("just now", "today", "yesterday"; default: past 24h)

### Step 2: Phase 1 — Event Search + Market Verification (Parallel)

| Step | MCP Tool | Parameters | Retrieved Data | Parallel |
|------|----------|------------|----------------|----------|
| 1a | `news_events_get_latest_events` | `coin={coin}, time_range="24h", limit=10` | Related event list | Yes |
| 1b | `info_marketsnapshot_get_market_snapshot` | `symbol={coin}, timeframe="1d", source="spot"` | Real-time market snapshot (verify volatility magnitude) | Yes |

> Both Tools called in parallel.

### Step 3: Decision Branch

```
events response
    │
    ├── Matching event found (event time aligns with volatility onset)
    │   └── → Step 4a: Get event details
    │
    └── No clear event match
        └── → Step 4b: Expand news search
```

### Step 4a: Event Found → Get Details + On-chain Verification

| Step | MCP Tool | Parameters | Retrieved Data | Parallel |
|------|----------|------------|----------------|----------|
| 2a | `news_events_get_event_detail` | `event_id={matched_event_id}` | Event details (cause, impact, timeline) | Yes |
| 2b | `info_onchain_get_token_onchain` | `token={coin}, chain="eth", scope="transfers"` | On-chain anomalies (large transfers, exchange inflows/outflows) | Yes |

### Step 4b: No Event Found → Expand Search

| Step | MCP Tool | Parameters | Retrieved Data | Parallel |
|------|----------|------------|----------------|----------|
| 2c | `news_feed_search_news` | `coin={coin}, sort_by="time", limit=15` | Latest related news (sorted by time) | Yes |
| 2d | `info_onchain_get_token_onchain` | `token={coin}, chain="eth", scope="transfers"` | On-chain anomalies | Yes |

### Step 5: LLM Attribution Reasoning

The LLM must complete the following reasoning chain:

1. **Confirm the volatility**: Based on the market snapshot, confirm the timing, magnitude, and volume change
2. **Identify the trigger event**: From events/news, find the event with the closest time alignment
3. **Verify causality**: Did the event precede the price move? Is there corresponding on-chain activity?
4. **Assess the impact chain**: Event → Direct impact → Sentiment transmission → Price reaction
5. **Evaluate follow-on potential**: Based on the event's nature, assess whether the impact is short-term or sustained

### Step 6: Output Structured Report

## Report Template

```markdown
## {coin} {Pump/Dump} Attribution Analysis

> Analysis time: {timestamp}

### 1. Volatility Summary

| Metric | Value |

| High | ${high} ({time}) |
| Low | ${low} ({time}) |
| Volume Change | {volume_change}% (vs 24h average) |
| Futures Liquidations | ${liquidation} (if available) |

### 2. Core Triggering Event

🔴 **{event_title}**

- Event Time: {event_time}

- Details: {2-3 sentence description}
- Source: {source}

### 3. Event → Impact Chain

```
{event}
  │
  ├── Direct Impact: {description}
  │     e.g., SEC lawsuit → Regulatory uncertainty for the token increases
  │
  ├── Sentiment Transmission: {description}
  │     e.g., Panic spreads → Fear & Greed Index drops from 65 to 35
  │
  └── Price Reaction: {description}
        e.g., {coin} dropped from ${high} to ${low} within 2 hours of the event
```

### 4. On-chain Verification

{If on-chain data is available:}

| On-chain Metric | Anomaly |
|----------------|---------|
| Exchange Inflows | {increase/decrease}, {description} |
| Large Transfers | {count} transfers exceeding ${threshold} |
| Whale Activity | {description} |
| Futures Funding Rate | {change description} |

{Does the on-chain data corroborate the event narrative?}

### 5. Ripple Effects

{Did this event affect other coins/sectors?}

- {Related coin 1}: {impact description}
- {Related coin 2}: {impact description}
- Sector impact: {e.g., L1 sector declined broadly, DeFi sector affected}

### 6. Forward Outlook

{Based on the event's nature, assess the follow-on impact:}

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Impact Duration | {One-time shock / Short-term (1-3 days) / Medium-term (1-2 weeks) / Long-term} |
| What to Watch Next | {Items to monitor: court ruling, policy details, project response, etc.} |
| Historical Precedent | {Similar past events and their outcomes, if any} |

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- Market moves may be caused by multiple overlapping factors; the above analysis is based on currently available information
- Long-term impact of the event remains uncertain

**On-chain Clues**
{Any anomalous on-chain data that could help explain the move?}

### Composite Assessment

{LLM's composite analysis, with uncertainty explicitly acknowledged}

> Note: No single clear triggering event was found for this move. The above analysis is an informed assessment based on available data.
```

---

## Reasoning Logic

### Event Matching Logic

| Condition | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Event time < price move start time | ✅ Temporally plausible as a trigger |
| Event time > price move start time | ❌ Unlikely to be the trigger (may be follow-up reporting) |
| Event impact rating = "High" | Weight +2 |
| Event involves the queried coin | Weight +3 |
| Event type = "Regulation/Policy" | Typically causes larger moves |
| Multiple events simultaneously | Composite analysis — likely multi-factor |

### Volatility Magnitude Assessment

| Magnitude | Label |
|-----------|-------|
| < 3% | Normal volatility — may not require a specific event explanation |
| 3% – 10% | Moderate volatility — look for recent news/events |
| 10% – 20% | Large volatility — typically has a clear event driver |
| > 20% | Extreme volatility — major event or black swan almost certain |

### On-chain Anomaly Assessment

| Condition | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Exchange inflows surge > 3x average | "Large token inflows to exchanges — potential selling pressure" |
| Exchange outflows surge > 3x average | "Large token outflows from exchanges — possible accumulation" |
| Large transfer count > 5x average | "Abnormally active large transfers" |
| Futures liquidations > $100M | "Massive futures liquidation cascade — amplified price volatility" |

---

## Error Handling

| Error Type | Handling |
|------------|----------|
| `news_events_get_latest_events` finds no matching event | Proceed to Step 4b — expand news search |
| `news_events_get_event_detail` fails | Generate report based on event list summaries only |
| `info_onchain_get_token_onchain` unavailable (P1 phase) | Skip on-chain verification section; note "On-chain data temporarily unavailable" |
| `info_marketsnapshot_get_market_snapshot` fails | Cannot confirm volatility magnitude; degrade to showing event info only |
| Both news and events return no results | Honestly inform the user "No clear cause has been identified at this time"; suggest monitoring for updates |
| All Tools fail | Return error message; suggest the user try again later |

---

## Cross-Skill Routing

| User Follow-up Intent | Route To |
|-----------------------|----------|
| "Analyze BTC for me" | `gate-info-coinanalysis` |
| "Give me a technical analysis" | `gate-info-trendanalysis` |
| "How's the overall market?" | `gate-info-marketoverview` |
| "Recent news?" | `gate-news-briefing` |
| "Any on-chain anomalies?" | `gate-info-tokenonchain` |
| "Track this address" | `gate-info-addresstracker` |

---

## Safety Rules

1. **No definitive causal claims**: Use language like "likely caused by", "the most closely related event is" — avoid absolute causal assertions
2. **No follow-on predictions**: Do not output "it will continue to rise/fall" style predictions
3. **No investment advice**: Do not give buy/sell recommendations based on event analysis
4. **Acknowledge uncertainty**: When the causal link between event and move is uncertain, explicitly state it
5. **Source attribution**: Events and news must cite their sources
6. **Flag missing data**: When on-chain data or event details are unavailable, explicitly state it
7. **Avoid amplifying panic**: When describing crashes or black-swan events, maintain objective, neutral language — no sensationalist rhetoric
