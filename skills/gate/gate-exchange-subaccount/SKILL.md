## General Rules

⚠️ STOP — You MUST read and strictly follow the shared runtime rules before proceeding.
Do NOT select or call any tool until all rules are read. These rules have the highest priority.
→ Read [gate-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/gate-runtime-rules.md)
- **Only call MCP tools explicitly listed in this skill.** Tools not documented here must NOT be called, even if they
  exist in the MCP server.

- cex_sa_unlock_sa

**Execution Operations (Write)**

- cex_sa_create_sa

### Authentication
- API Key Required: Yes (see skill doc/runtime MCP deployment)
- Permissions: Sa:Write
- Get API Key: https://www.gate.io/myaccount/profile/api-key/manage

### Installation Check
- Required: Gate (main)

## Prerequisites

- **MCP Dependency**: Requires [gate-mcp](https://github.com/gate/gate-mcp) to be installed.
- **Authentication**: All sub-account operations require API key authentication with main-account privileges.
- **Permission**: The current user must be a main account holder to manage sub-accounts.

## Available MCP Tools

| Tool | Auth | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `cex_sa_get_sa` | Yes | Get details of a specific sub-account by user ID |
| `cex_sa_list_sas` | Yes | List all sub-accounts under the main account |
| `cex_sa_create_sa` | Yes | Create a new normal sub-account |
| `cex_sa_lock_sa` | Yes | Lock a sub-account to disable login and trading |
| `cex_sa_unlock_sa` | Yes | Unlock a previously locked sub-account |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify User Intent

Parse the user's message to determine which sub-account operation they need.

Key data to extract:
- `intent`: One of `query_status`, `list_all`, `create`, `lock`, `unlock`
- `user_id`: Sub-account UID (required for `query_status`, `lock`, `unlock`)
- `login_name`: Desired username (for `create`, may need to ask user)

Intent detection rules:

| Signal Keywords | Intent |
|----------------|--------|
| "status of sub-account", "sub-account UID {id}", "check sub-account" | `query_status` |
| "all sub-accounts", "list sub-accounts", "my sub-accounts", "which sub-accounts" | `list_all` |
| "create sub-account", "new sub-account", "add sub-account" | `create` |
| "lock sub-account", "disable sub-account", "freeze sub-account" | `lock` |
| "unlock sub-account", "enable sub-account", "unfreeze sub-account" | `unlock` |

### Step 2: Execute by Intent

#### Case A: Query Sub-Account Status (`query_status`)

Call `cex_sa_get_sa` with:
- `user_id`: The sub-account UID provided by the user

Key data to extract:
- `login_name`: Sub-account username
- `remark`: Sub-account remark/note
- `state`: Account state (normal / locked)
- `type`: Account type (normal / pool)
- `create_time`: Account creation timestamp

Present the sub-account details in a structured format.

#### Case B: List All Sub-Accounts (`list_all`)

Call `cex_sa_list_sas` with:
- `type`: "0" (normal sub-accounts only)

Key data to extract:
- For each sub-account: `user_id`, `login_name`, `remark`, `state`, `create_time`

Present results as a table with username, UID, remark (if any), and current status.

#### Case C: Create Sub-Account (`create`)

**Pre-check**: Call `cex_sa_list_sas` with `type`: "0" to get the current list of normal sub-accounts. Check if the user can still create more sub-accounts based on the returned count.

If creation is available:
1. Ask the user to provide a login name for the new sub-account
2. Optionally collect: email, remark
3. Confirm all details with the user before proceeding
4. Call `cex_sa_create_sa` with:
   - `login_name`: User-provided login name (required)
   - `email`: User-provided email (optional)
   - `remark`: User-provided remark (optional)
5. Present the newly created sub-account details

Key data to extract:
- `user_id`: Newly created sub-account UID
- `login_name`: Confirmed username
- `state`: Should be "normal"

**Important**: Only normal sub-accounts can be created through this skill.

#### Case D: Lock Sub-Account (`lock`)

1. Validate that `user_id` is provided; if not, ask the user
2. Call `cex_sa_get_sa` with `user_id` to verify the sub-account exists and belongs to the main account
3. If the sub-account is already locked, inform the user and stop
4. Confirm with the user: "Are you sure you want to lock sub-account {user_id} ({login_name})? This will disable login and trading for this sub-account."
5. On confirmation, call `cex_sa_lock_sa` with:
   - `user_id`: The sub-account UID
6. Report the result

Key data to extract:
- Lock operation success/failure status

#### Case E: Unlock Sub-Account (`unlock`)

1. Validate that `user_id` is provided; if not, ask the user
2. Call `cex_sa_get_sa` with `user_id` to verify the sub-account exists and is currently locked
3. If the sub-account is already unlocked/normal, inform the user and stop
4. Confirm with the user: "Are you sure you want to unlock sub-account {user_id} ({login_name})?"
5. On confirmation, call `cex_sa_unlock_sa` with:
   - `user_id`: The sub-account UID
6. Report the result

Key data to extract:
- Unlock operation success/failure status

### Step 3: Format and Respond

## Judgment Logic Summary

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| User asks for a specific sub-account status with UID | Route to Case A: `query_status` |
| User asks to see all sub-accounts | Route to Case B: `list_all` |
| User wants to create a new sub-account | Route to Case C: `create` |
| User wants to lock a sub-account with UID | Route to Case D: `lock` |
| User wants to unlock a sub-account with UID | Route to Case E: `unlock` |
| UID not provided for operations requiring it | Ask user for the sub-account UID |
| Login name not provided for creation | Ask user for a login name |
| Sub-account already in target state (lock/unlock) | Inform user, no action needed |
| API returns authentication error | Prompt user to log in |
| API returns permission error | Inform user that main account privileges are required |
| Sub-account does not exist or does not belong to user | Inform user the UID is invalid |

## Domain Knowledge

- A main account on Gate can create multiple sub-accounts for asset isolation, strategy separation, or team management.
- Sub-accounts share the main account's KYC verification but have independent trading and wallet capabilities.
- Locking a sub-account disables both login and trading; the assets remain safe but inaccessible until unlocked.
- There are two types of sub-accounts: normal (type=0) and pool (type=1). This skill only supports creating normal sub-accounts.
- Sub-account creation requires a unique login name. Email and remark are optional.

## Safety Rules

- **Write operations** (`cex_sa_create_sa`, `cex_sa_lock_sa`, `cex_sa_unlock_sa`): Always require explicit user confirmation before execution. Never auto-execute.
- **UID validation**: Before lock/unlock, always verify the sub-account exists and belongs to the current main account.
- **State check**: Before lock/unlock, check current state to avoid redundant operations.
- **No sensitive data exposure**: Never expose API keys, internal endpoint URLs, or raw error traces.
- **Normal sub-accounts only**: Creation is restricted to normal sub-accounts (type=0). Do not attempt to create pool sub-accounts.

## Error Handling

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Auth endpoint returns "not login" | "Please log in to your Gate account first." |
| User is not a main account | "Sub-account management requires main account privileges. Please switch to your main account." |
| Sub-account UID not found | "Sub-account with UID {user_id} was not found. Please verify the UID and try again." |
| Sub-account does not belong to user | "This sub-account does not belong to your main account." |
| Sub-account already locked | "Sub-account {user_id} is already locked. No action needed." |
| Sub-account already unlocked | "Sub-account {user_id} is already in normal (unlocked) state. No action needed." |
| Create sub-account fails (limit reached) | "You have reached the maximum number of sub-accounts. Please contact support if you need more." |
| Create sub-account fails (duplicate name) | "The login name '{login_name}' is already taken. Please choose a different name." |
| Unknown error | "An error occurred while processing your request. Please try again later." |
