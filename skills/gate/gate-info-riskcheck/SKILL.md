description: "Token and address risk assessment. Use this skill ONLY when the user's query is exclusively about token/contract/address security with no other analysis dimensions. Trigger phrases: is this token safe, check contract risk, is this address safe, honeypot, rug. If the query ALSO mentions fundamentals, technicals, news, sentiment, or any other analysis dimension, use gate-info-research instead — it handles multi-dimension queries in a single unified report. Address risk mode (is this address safe) is exclusive to this skill and must NOT be routed to gate-info-research."

# gate-info-riskcheck

## General Rules

⚠️ STOP — You MUST read and strictly follow the shared runtime rules before proceeding.
Do NOT select or call any tool until all rules are read. These rules have the highest priority.
→ Read [gate-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/gate-runtime-rules.md)
→ Also read [info-news-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/info-news-runtime-rules.md) for **gate-info** / **gate-news**-specific rules (tool degradation, report standards, security, routing degradation, and per-skill version checks when `scripts/` is present).
- **Only call MCP tools explicitly listed in this skill.** Tools not documented here must NOT be called, even if they
  exist in the MCP server.

> Security guardian Skill. The user inputs a token name or contract address, the system calls the contract security detection Tool to retrieve 30+ risk detection results, tax analysis, holder concentration, and name risk data. The LLM aggregates the results into a structured risk assessment report. Address compliance checking will be added in a future phase.

**Trigger Scenarios**: User mentions a token/contract address + keywords like safe, risk, check, audit, honeypot, rug, contract security, scam.

**Per-skill updates:** This directory includes `scripts/update-skill.sh` and `scripts/update-skill.ps1`. Policy: [info-news-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/info-news-runtime-rules.md) §1. The **Trigger update** steps below apply in addition to [gate-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/gate-runtime-rules.md); when scripts are present, use this flow for version checks before execution.

---

## Trigger update (with Execution)

**Default (PD / blocking):** On each trigger, run **`check`** first **without** **`GATE_SKILL_UPDATE_MODE=auto`**. The script **only compares** local vs remote; if `Result=update_available`, it **does not** overwrite files. **STOP** — ask the user whether to update **before** any **`apply`**, **`run`**, or skill Execution. In sandboxes (e.g. Cursor), use **full / all permissions** when later running **`apply`**. This matches **blocking update confirmation** in the independent-script TEST_REPORT: blocking is enforced by these SKILL instructions plus **check-only** behavior (not by silent auto-apply).

**Strict check (Agent / IDE — recommended on `check`):** Use **`GATE_SKILL_CHECK_STRICT=1`**. When `Result=update_available`, **`check`** **exits 3** and prints **`GATE_SKILL_CHECK_EXIT=3`** — it stops **only** that shell step. **Hard rule:** after you ask the user, **end this assistant turn**; do **not** call **`apply`**, **`run`**, or MCP in the **same** message. **`run`** applies without a prior user step — **do not** use **`run`** in chat for the blocking flow; use **`check` → user confirms → `apply`**.

### Step 1 — Check

**Install root:** `check` / `apply` read **`$DEST/SKILL.md`**. Typical **`$SKILL_ROOT`**: **`$HOME/.cursor/skills/<name>/`**, **`$HOME/.codex/skills/<name>/`**, **`$HOME/.openclaw/skills/<name>/`**, **`$HOME/.agents/skills/<name>/`**, **`$HOME/.gemini/antigravity/skills/<name>/`**. Single-arg: the script resolves **`DEST`** in that order when **`SKILL.md`** exists; otherwise **`DEST`** is `scripts/../`. Workspace-only trees need two-arg **`check`** / **`apply`** with explicit **`DEST`**.

**Bash** (blocking — no auto; example Cursor):

```bash
GATE_SKILL_CHECK_STRICT=1 bash "$HOME/.cursor/skills/gate-info-riskcheck/scripts/update-skill.sh" check "gate-info-riskcheck"
```

**PowerShell:**

```powershell
$env:GATE_SKILL_CHECK_STRICT = '1'
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.cursor\skills\gate-info-riskcheck\scripts\update-skill.ps1" check "gate-info-riskcheck"
```

**Result semantics:** `skipped` = no action. `update_available` = remote newer; **with blocking flow, do not apply until the user agrees**. `check_failed` = could not compare — proceed with current version per [info-news-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/info-news-runtime-rules.md).

**Agent parse (stdout):** `GATE_SKILL_UPDATE_AGENT_ACTION=…`. **`BLOCK_UNTIL_USER_CONFIRMS_UPDATE`** → Step 2 before Execution. **`CONTINUE_SKILL_EXECUTION`** → no block from the check script.

### Step 2 — Confirm or Reject (blocking)

**If `update_available`:**

1. **STOP** — do NOT proceed to Execution yet.
2. Inform the user (e.g. newer version available; summarize if helpful).
3. **Wait for the user’s reply** — blocking step.

   **Hard rule (Cursor / Agent):** When `check` reports **`update_available`**, or **`BLOCK_UNTIL_USER_CONFIRMS_UPDATE`**, or strict **`exit 3`**, **end this turn** after asking. **Only** in the **user’s next message** run **`apply`** (if they agree) or **`revoke-pending`** (if they decline). Do **not** chain **`apply`** in the same turn as **`check`** for this flow.

   - User **agrees** → run **`apply`** with **`GATE_SKILL_CONFIRM_TOKEN`** from strict **`check`** stdout when required, then Execution.
   - User **declines** → **`revoke-pending`**, then Execution on the current install.

**Two-step gate (strict `check`):** **`apply`** / **`run`** (without **`GATE_SKILL_UPDATE_MODE=auto`**) **fail** until **`GATE_SKILL_CONFIRM_TOKEN`** matches **`.gate-skill-apply-token`**. User decline → **`revoke-pending`**.

```bash
GATE_SKILL_CONFIRM_TOKEN="<paste from check stdout>" bash "$HOME/.cursor/skills/gate-info-riskcheck/scripts/update-skill.sh" apply "gate-info-riskcheck"
```

```bash
bash "$HOME/.cursor/skills/gate-info-riskcheck/scripts/update-skill.sh" revoke-pending "gate-info-riskcheck"
```

```powershell
$env:GATE_SKILL_CONFIRM_TOKEN = '<paste from check stdout>'
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.cursor\skills\gate-info-riskcheck\scripts\update-skill.ps1" apply "gate-info-riskcheck"
```

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.cursor\skills\gate-info-riskcheck\scripts\update-skill.ps1" revoke-pending "gate-info-riskcheck"
```

**If Step 1 was not strict** (no pending token): **`apply`** without **`GATE_SKILL_CONFIRM_TOKEN`** is allowed.

**If `skipped` or `check_failed`:** no update step; proceed to Execution.

### Optional — `GATE_SKILL_UPDATE_MODE=auto`

For **CI / unattended automation only**: setting **`GATE_SKILL_UPDATE_MODE=auto`** on **`check`** makes the script **apply immediately** when the remote is newer — **no** user confirmation and **incompatible** with **blocking update confirmation** tests. Do **not** use **`auto`** on **`check`** when reproducing the blocking PD flow.

### Parameters

- **name**: Frontmatter `name` above; must match `skills/<name>/` on gate-skills.
- **Invoke**: Use **`$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/update-skill.sh`** (or `.ps1`) where **`$SKILL_ROOT/SKILL.md`** is this skill — e.g. **`~/.cursor/skills/<name>`**, **`~/.codex/skills/<name>`**, **`~/.openclaw/skills/<name>`**, **`~/.agents/skills/<name>`**, **`~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/<name>`**; do not treat **`~/.cursor`** (or any host root without **`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`**) as the install. With one arg, the script resolves **`$SKILL_ROOT`** in that order before falling back to the script’s directory; workspace installs need **explicit `DEST`**.

**Do not** dump raw script logs into the user-facing reply except when debugging. On **`check` exit 3** (strict), do not run Execution until Step 2 is resolved. On **`check_failed`** or **`apply` failure**, still run Execution when appropriate per runtime rules.

---

## Execution Workflow

### Step 0: Multi-Dimension Intent Check

Before executing this Skill, check if the user's query involves multiple analysis dimensions:

- If the query is about **address safety** (e.g., "is this address safe", "check 0x..."), proceed with this Skill (Mode B) — address risk is exclusive to this Skill and NOT covered by `gate-info-research`.
- If the query is **only** about token/contract security with no other dimension, proceed with this Skill (Mode A).
- If the query **also** mentions fundamentals, technicals, news, sentiment, comparison, or any other analysis dimension beyond security, route to `gate-info-research` — it handles multi-dimension queries with unified tool deduplication and coherent report aggregation.

### Mode A: Token Security Check (Core Mode — Ready)

#### Step 1: Intent Recognition & Parameter Extraction

Extract from user input:
- `token`: Token symbol (e.g., PEPE, SHIB) — mutually exclusive with `address`
- `address`: Contract address (e.g., 0x...) — mutually exclusive with `token`
- `chain`: Chain name (eth / bsc / solana / base / arb, etc.) — **required**

**Parameter Completion Strategy**:
- If user provides only token without chain: ask "Please specify the chain (e.g., eth, bsc, solana)"
- If user provides a contract address without chain: attempt to infer from address format (0x prefix likely EVM chain, but still confirm specific chain)
- If user asks about major coins (BTC, ETH): inform them "Major coins typically have no contract security risks. If you need to check, please specify the wrapped token or a Meme token on a specific chain"

#### Step 2: Call 2 MCP Tools in Parallel

| Step | MCP Tool | Parameters | Retrieved Data | Parallel |
|------|----------|------------|----------------|----------|
| 1a | `info_compliance_check_token_security` | `token={token} or address={address}, chain={chain}, scope="full", lang="en"` | Risk level, 30+ risk items, tax analysis, holder concentration, name risk, honeypot detection, open-source status | Yes |
| 1b | `info_coin_get_coin_info` | `query={token or symbol}` | Token basic info (project name, sector, listed exchanges — supplementary context) | Yes |

> Both Tools are called in parallel with no dependencies.

#### Step 3: LLM Aggregation — Generate Risk Report

Pass the security detection data and fundamentals to the LLM to generate the assessment report using the template below.

### Mode B: Address Risk Check (Degraded Mode)

> `info_compliance_check_address_risk` is not yet available (P3 phase). Currently only `info_onchain_get_address_info` can provide basic address information.

| Step | MCP Tool | Parameters | Retrieved Data | Status |
|------|----------|------------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | `info_onchain_get_address_info` | `address={address}, chain={chain}` | Basic address info, balance, transaction count | ✅ Available |
| 2 | `info_compliance_check_address_risk` | — | Address compliance risk labels | ❌ Not ready |

**Degradation Handling**: Inform the user "Address compliance risk detection is under development. Currently only basic address information is available. For token contract security checks, please provide the token name or contract address."

## Decision Logic

| Condition | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| `is_honeypot == true` | **Highest-level warning**: "⛔ Detected as honeypot contract — extremely likely unable to sell. Do NOT purchase." |
| `is_open_source == false` | Flag "Contract is not open-source — code logic cannot be audited, elevated risk" |
| `buy_tax > 5%` or `sell_tax > 5%` | Flag "Abnormally high tax rate — extreme trading costs" |
| `buy_tax > 10%` or `sell_tax > 10%` | Flag "⛔ Extreme tax rate — suspected malicious contract" |
| `top10_percent > 50%` | Flag "Highly concentrated holdings — insider/whale dump risk" |
| `top10_percent > 80%` | Flag "⛔ Extremely concentrated holdings — dump risk is critical" |
| `dev_holding_percent > 10%` | Flag "Developer holdings are elevated — watch for sell-off risk" |
| `holder_count < 100` | Flag "Extremely few holders — insufficient liquidity and decentralization" |
| `high_risk_num > 0` | List each high-risk item with explanation |
| `high_risk_num == 0 && middle_risk_num <= 2` | Flag "Contract security check passed — no significant risks detected" |
| `is_domain_token == true` | Flag "This is a domain token — unrelated to the project of the same name. Verify carefully." |
| `is_sensitive == true` | Flag "Token name contains sensitive words — possible impersonation/fraud risk" |
| Any Tool returns empty/error | Skip that section; note "Data unavailable" in the report |

---

## Risk Level Mapping

| `highest_risk_level` Value | Risk Level | Label | Description |
|---------------------------|------------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Safe | ✅ Safe | No risk items detected |
| 1 | Low Risk | Low Risk | Only low-risk items present |
| 2 | Medium Risk | Medium Risk | Medium-risk items present — monitor |
| 3 | High Risk | High Risk | High-risk items present — exercise extreme caution |
| is_honeypot=true | Critical Risk | ⛔ Critical Risk | Honeypot contract — strongly advise staying away |

---

## Error Handling

| Error Type | Handling |
|------------|----------|
| Missing chain parameter | Prompt user: "Please specify the chain (e.g., eth, bsc, solana, base, arb)" |
| Neither token nor address provided | Prompt user: "Please provide a token symbol or contract address" |
| Contract address does not exist / unrecognizable | Prompt user to verify the address and confirm the chain |
| Token is a major coin (BTC/ETH, etc.) | Inform: "Major coins typically have no contract security risks. For contract token checks, specify the wrapped token or Meme token on a specific chain" |
| check_token_security timeout/error | Return error message; suggest trying again later |
| Address risk query (currently unavailable) | Inform: "Address compliance detection is under development." Guide user to `gate-info-addresstracker` for basic address info |
| User inputs a regular address thinking it's a contract | Attempt detection; if empty result, inform "This may not be a contract address. For address information, use the Address Tracker feature" |

## Safety Rules

1. **Mandatory honeypot warning**: When `is_honeypot=true` is detected, display the "⛔ Critical Risk" warning in the most prominent position — never downplay
2. **No investment advice**: Risk assessment is based on on-chain data and must include a "not investment advice" disclaimer
3. **No absolute safety guarantees**: Even if all checks pass, state that "automated detection cannot cover all risks"
4. **Data transparency**: Label detection data source and timestamp
5. **Flag missing data**: When any dimension has no data, explicitly inform the user — never fabricate safety conclusions
6. **Address privacy**: Do not proactively expose address holder identities — only display publicly available on-chain data
