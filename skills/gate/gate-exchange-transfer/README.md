# Gate Exchange Transfer

## Overview

A skill for Gate Exchange internal fund transfers. Covers transfers between account types (spot, margin, futures, delivery, options), main-sub-account transfers, and sub-account to sub-account transfers.

### Core Capabilities

- Transfer between main account types (spot ↔ margin ↔ futures ↔ delivery ↔ options)
- Transfer from main account to sub-account
- Transfer from sub-account to main account
- Transfer between two sub-accounts
- Query transfer status

### Execution Guardrail (Mandatory)

Before any transfer execution, the assistant must:

1. Verify source account balance (sufficient funds)
2. Present a **Transfer Draft** (currency, amount, from, to)
3. Wait for explicit user confirmation (e.g. `Confirm transfer`, `Confirm`, `Proceed`)
4. Execute only after confirmation

If confirmation is missing or ambiguous, do not execute the transfer.
