# Gate Exchange Transfer (Internal Transfer)

## General Rules

⚠️ STOP — You MUST read and strictly follow the shared runtime rules before proceeding.
Do NOT select or call any tool until all rules are read. These rules have the highest priority.
→ Read [gate-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/gate-runtime-rules.md)
- **Only call MCP tools explicitly listed in this skill.** Tools not documented here must NOT be called, even if they
  exist in the MCP server.

Execute same-UID internal transfers between Gate trading accounts: **spot**, **isolated margin**, **perpetual**, **delivery**, and **options**. Single execution endpoint: `POST /wallet/transfers` (MCP: `cex_wallet_create_transfer`).

**Scope (Phase 1)**  
- Supported: internal transfer only (same UID, between account types above).  
- Not supported: main-to-sub, sub-to-main, sub-to-sub. See `references/scenarios.md` for future scenario coverage.

## The Four Elements

Every internal transfer is fully specified by four elements. The assistant must resolve or infer them before showing a **Transfer Draft**.

| Element | API param | Required when | Notes |
|---------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| **From** | `from` | Always | spot \| margin \| futures \| delivery \| options |
| **To** | `to` | Always | Same enum as `from` |
| **Currency** | `currency` | Always | USDT, BTC, etc. (platform-supported). Missing → auto-complete by target (case2). |
| **Amount** | `amount` | Always | String, > 0, up to 8 decimals. Missing → ask user (case8). |

**Conditional params**  
- **margin**: `currency_pair` required (e.g. `BTC_USDT`) when `from` or `to` is `margin`.  
- **futures / delivery**: `settle` required (`usdt` \| `btc`) when `from` or `to` is `futures` or `delivery`.

---

## Public API (Phase 1)

| Endpoint | Method | Meaning | Rate limit |
|----------|--------|---------|------------|
| `/wallet/transfers` | POST | Same-UID internal transfer | 80 req/10s |

---

## Tool Mapping

| Group | Tool (`jsonrpc: call.method`) |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| Main account internal transfer | `cex_wallet_create_transfer` |

---

## Case Index

| Case | Scenario | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| case1 | All four elements present | Show Transfer Draft → confirm → call API → Transfer Result Report |
| case2 | Currency missing | Auto-complete currency by target account → same as case1 |
| case3 | Transfer completed (API success) | Output Transfer Result Report + product suggestion |
| case4 | Insufficient balance | Pre-check fails; no API call; show shortfall and suggest deposit/adjust |
| case5 | Missing from/to or ambiguous intent | Show missing-info card; do not call API |
| case6 | Account mode conflict (e.g. trading account → USDT perpetual not allowed) | Explain and suggest alternative path |
| case7 | Currency vs To mismatch (e.g. USDT to BTC perpetual) | Auto-correct or prompt correction → then case1 |
| case8 | Amount missing | Ask for amount; after user provides, proceed to case1/case2 |
| case9 | User cancels or declines after draft | Acknowledge; do not call API |
| case10 | Confirmation ambiguous or stale | Re-present draft; ask for explicit "Confirm" / "Yes"; do not execute |
| case11 | Rate limit / service error | Do not retry blindly; prompt retry later or use web UI |

---

## Transfer Draft (Mandatory before execution)

Before calling `cex_wallet_create_transfer`, output a **Transfer Draft** and wait for explicit confirmation in the **immediately following** user turn.

**Draft contents**  
- `from` (account name)  
- `to` (account name)  
- `currency`  
- `amount`  
- If applicable: `settle` (for futures/delivery), `currency_pair` (for margin)

**Confirmation rule**  
- Treat confirmation as **single-use**. If user changes amount, currency, or direction, show a new draft and re-confirm.  
- If user does not clearly confirm (e.g. "Confirm", "Yes", "Proceed"), do **not** execute (case10).

---

## Transfer Result Report (After successful API call)

- Confirm success: e.g. "Transfer successful. {amount} {currency} has arrived in your {to account name}."  
- Optionally suggest next step by destination: Spot → spot trading; USDT perpetual → USDT-margined perpetual; etc.  
- Mention transfer history: e.g. transfer/historyV2 or equivalent MCP tool.

---

## Case Logic and Output

### case1: All four elements present

**Trigger**  
"Transfer 100 USDT from my spot account to perpetual futures account" / "Transfer 1000 USDT from spot to USDT-margined futures" / "Transfer 0.5 BTC from coin-margined to spot"

**Steps**  
1. Resolve `from`, `to`, `currency`, `amount`; add `settle` or `currency_pair` if needed.  
2. Pre-check: fetch source balance; if balance < amount → case4.  
3. Output **Transfer Draft**.  
4. Wait for explicit confirmation.  
5. Call `cex_wallet_create_transfer`.  
6. Output **Transfer Result Report** (case3).

**Request mapping**

| Intent | API parameter | Values |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Source account | `from` | spot \| margin \| futures \| delivery \| options |
| Target account | `to` | spot \| margin \| futures \| delivery \| options |
| Currency | `currency` | USDT, BTC, etc. |
| Amount | `amount` | String, > 0, up to 8 decimals |
| Margin pair | `currency_pair` | Required if from/to is margin, e.g. BTC_USDT |
| Settlement | `settle` | Required if from/to is futures or delivery: usdt \| btc |

---

### case2: Currency missing, auto-complete

**Trigger**  
"Transfer 100 to my USDT-margined account" / "Transfer 500 to futures" / "Transfer 1000 to perpetual"

**Logic**  
Set `currency` by target account:

| Target account | Default currency |
|----------------|------------------|
| USDT perpetual (futures settle=usdt) | USDT |
| BTC perpetual (futures settle=btc) | BTC |
| TradFi | USDT |
| Delivery | USDT |
| Options | USDT |
| Spot / margin | Infer from context or ask |

**Steps**  
Same as case1 after `currency` is set.

**Output (draft)**  
"Detected transfer of {amount} to {to account name}. Based on account type, default currency is {currency}. Please confirm."

---

### case3: Transfer completed (API success)

**Trigger**  
User confirmed; `cex_wallet_create_transfer` returned success.

**Output**  
- "Transfer successful. {amount} {currency} has arrived in your {to account name}."  
- Optional: product suggestion by destination (spot / USDT perpetual / BTC perpetual / delivery / margin / TradFi / options).  
- "Transfer history: transfer/historyV2" (or equivalent).

---

### case4: Insufficient balance

**Trigger**  
Pre-check: source available balance < transfer amount.

**Action**  
Do **not** call transfer API.

**Output**  
"Your {from account name} has insufficient balance (available: {available} {currency}). Please adjust the amount or deposit first."

---

### case5: Missing from/to or ambiguous intent

**Trigger**  
"Contract is about to be liquidated, transfer some funds for margin" / "Top up my futures margin" / "How do I adjust account funds"

**Logic**  
- If missing ≥ 2 of from, to, currency, amount: show **missing-info card** and ask user to provide.  
- Defaults when only one side is clear:  
  - Unified/trading account advanced mode: default from = Trading account, to = BTC perpetual.  
  - Classic: default from = Spot, to = USDT perpetual.  
- Do **not** call API until four elements are clear.

**Output**  
"I can help with margin top-up. Please specify: from account, to account, and currency (and amount if you know it)."

---

### case6: Account mode conflict

**Trigger**  
User in **trading account advanced mode** asks to transfer to USDT perpetual. In this mode, direct transfer to USDT perpetual may be disallowed (path not available).

**Output**  
"You are in trading account mode; direct transfer to USDT perpetual is not available. You can transfer to BTC perpetual (coin-margined) instead, or adjust account mode on the web."

---

### case7: Currency vs To account mismatch

**Trigger**  
"Transfer some USDT to my BTC perpetual account"

**Logic**  
BTC perpetual settles in BTC; USDT is inconsistent.  
- **Option A**: Correct to BTC amount (if user intent allows).  
- **Option B**: Explain that BTC perpetual uses BTC; suggest transferring BTC or using USDT perpetual for USDT.  
- If user confirms a corrected draft (e.g. spot → BTC perpetual with BTC), proceed as case1.

**Output**  
"BTC perpetual uses BTC settlement. I've corrected the transfer to use BTC (or: please specify amount in BTC). Please confirm." Or: "For USDT, use USDT perpetual account instead."

---

### case8: Amount missing

**Trigger**  
"Transfer USDT from spot to futures" / "Move my USDT to perpetual" (no amount).

**Action**  
Ask: "How much {currency} do you want to transfer from {from} to {to}?" After user provides amount, resolve currency if still missing (case2), then proceed to case1.

---

### case9: User cancels or declines

**Trigger**  
After Transfer Draft, user says "No" / "Cancel" / "Don't do it" / "Never mind".

**Action**  
Do **not** call API. Acknowledge: "Transfer cancelled. No changes made."

---

### case10: Confirmation ambiguous or stale

**Trigger**  
After draft, user replies with something other than clear confirmation (e.g. new question, different amount, or vague "ok" in a long thread).

**Action**  
Do **not** execute. Re-present the Transfer Draft and say: "To execute this transfer, please confirm explicitly (e.g. 'Confirm' or 'Yes')."

---

### case11: Rate limit or service error

**Trigger**  
API returns `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS` or server/network error.

**Action**  
Do not retry automatically in the same turn.  
**Output**  
"Request failed (rate limit / service error). Please try again later or use the web app to transfer."

## Execution Rules (Summary)

1. **Single endpoint**: Internal transfer only via `POST /wallet/transfers` (`cex_wallet_create_transfer`). No main-sub in Phase 1.  
2. **Always show Transfer Draft** with from, to, currency, amount (and settle/currency_pair if needed).  
3. **Require explicit confirmation** in the next user turn; single-use; re-confirm if params change.  
4. **Pre-check balance** before calling API; on insufficient balance, follow case4 and do not call.  
5. **Conditional params**: `currency_pair` for margin; `settle` for futures/delivery.  
6. **Missing currency**: case2 default table. **Missing amount**: case8 ask.  
7. **Account mode / currency mismatch**: case6 and case7; resolve or correct before executing.  
8. **On cancel or ambiguous confirm**: case9/case10; do not execute.
