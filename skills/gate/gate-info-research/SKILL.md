# Market Research Copilot

> L2 composite skill — orchestrates 12 read-only MCP Tool Calls across **Gate-Info MCP** (8 tools) and **Gate-News MCP** (4 tools) to aggregate multi-source market intelligence into structured, citation-backed reports. **No trading, swaps, staking, or any fund-moving operations.**

**Trigger Scenarios**: User intent is "research / understand / analyze" — market overview, single-coin analysis, multi-coin comparison, technical trends, event attribution, risk check, or daily briefing.

**Target Users**: Casual / beginner traders, content-oriented users, and pre-decision users who need to quickly understand the market, a coin, or risk before acting.

## General Rules

⚠️ STOP — You MUST read and strictly follow the shared runtime rules before proceeding.
Do NOT select or call any tool until all rules are read. These rules have the highest priority.
→ Read [gate-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/gate-runtime-rules.md)
- **Only call MCP tools explicitly listed in this skill.** Tools not documented here must NOT be called, even if they
  exist in the MCP server.

## Domain Knowledge

### Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Truth |
|---------------|-------|
| "Analyze BTC then buy it for me" will trigger a trade | This Skill only produces analysis. Execution intent is routed to trading skills (e.g., `gate-exchange-spot`). |
| Analysis conclusions = investment advice | Output must distinguish "data-driven analysis" from "investment advice". Never promise returns. |

### Design Rationale: 5-Dimension Signal Stacking

User queries often span multiple analysis dimensions (e.g., "How is BTC doing?" implies fundamentals + technicals + news). Forcing a single-intent classification is fragile. This Skill uses **dimension signal stacking** instead of N-choose-1 classification: independently detect 5 signal dimensions from the query, each activated dimension contributes a set of Tool Calls, and the final tool set is their union. Running 5 independent binary classifiers is far more stable than 1 nine-way classifier.

### L1 Skill to Tool Mapping

| L1 Skill | Tools Used |
|----------|------------|
| gate-info-marketoverview | `info_marketsnapshot_get_market_snapshot`, `info_platformmetrics_get_defi_overview`, `news_events_get_latest_events` |
| gate-info-coinanalysis | `info_coin_get_coin_info`, `info_marketsnapshot_get_market_snapshot`, `info_markettrend_get_technical_analysis`, `news_feed_search_news`, `news_feed_get_social_sentiment` |

| gate-info-coincompare | `info_marketsnapshot_get_market_snapshot` x N, `info_coin_get_coin_info` x N, `info_markettrend_get_technical_analysis` x N (optional) |
| gate-info-riskcheck | `info_compliance_check_token_security`, `info_coin_get_coin_info` |

### Key Parameter Notes

- `info_marketsnapshot_get_market_snapshot`: Always pass `source="spot"` to avoid non-standard pair data contamination.
- `info_markettrend_get_kline`: Always pass `source="spot"` — without this constraint, price data may include DEX non-standard pairs, producing incorrect prices. **This is a mandatory parameter.**
- `info_compliance_check_token_security`: Requires `chain` parameter; skip for major coins (BTC/ETH) where contract audit is not applicable.
- `info_onchain_get_token_onchain`: Some tokens return empty results — this is expected; skip the on-chain section and annotate "On-chain data unavailable".

---

## Workflow

For concrete prompt examples and expected behavior per scenario, see `references/scenarios.md`.

**MCP tool calls**: Only **Step 3** invokes Gate-Info / Gate-News MCP tools (`info_*`, `news_*`). **Steps 1, 2, 4, and 5** are orchestration, signal planning, aggregation, and formatting — **no MCP tool call in those steps**.

### Step 1: Intent Gate — Research vs. Execution

Determine if the user wants to **research** or **execute**.

- **Research intent** (enter this Skill): understand, analyze, compare, briefing, risk check, trend, why pumping/dumping, sentiment, fundamentals, worth buying, overview, report.
- **Execution intent** (route away): buy, sell, swap, stake, transfer, withdraw, place order, close position.

If the user mixes both (e.g., "analyze BTC then buy"), split into two phases: complete the research phase within this Skill, then route the execution phase to the appropriate trading skill (e.g., `gate-exchange-spot`).

Key data to extract:
- `intent_type`: "research" or "execution"

### Step 2: Parameter Extraction & 5-Dimension Signal Detection

Extract parameters from the user query:
- `symbols[]`: Coin tickers (0 to N). Map project names to tickers (Solana -> SOL, Chainlink -> LINK).
- `sector`: Optional sector (DeFi, Layer2, Meme, etc.)
- `time_range`: Time scope (default 24h)

Then independently evaluate each of the 5 signal dimensions (non-exclusive, multiple can fire):

| Signal | Dimension | Trigger Condition | Trigger Keywords (illustrative English cues only; match **intent** in **any** human language, not literal string-only) | Activated Tools |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| S1 | Market / Macro | No specific coin + broad market focus | market, overall, sector, broad market, majors, macro, daily brief, today, rates / policy, hot sectors, tape, whole-market view | `info_marketsnapshot_get_market_snapshot`(BTC/ETH/top coins), `info_platformmetrics_get_defi_overview`, `news_events_get_latest_events` |
| S2 | Fundamentals / Project | Specific coin + project attribute focus | fundamentals, project, funding, team, tokenomics, worth buying, upside, quality, how is it | `info_coin_get_coin_info`({symbol}), `info_marketsnapshot_get_market_snapshot`({symbol}) |
| S3 | Technicals / K-line | Specific coin + price/indicator focus; **or** user wording (any language) **semantically** asks for a **holistic / comprehensive** read that includes **market or technical** stance per coin (often alongside fundamentals). **Intent-based**, not a closed keyword list. | **Price / indicators**: K-line, candlestick, support, resistance, levels, overbought, oversold, RSI, MACD, Bollinger, technicals, trend, pattern, trajectory, outlook, follow-up path · **Holistic**: comprehensive, holistic, full picture, overall | `info_markettrend_get_kline`, `info_markettrend_get_indicator_history`, `info_markettrend_get_technical_analysis`, `info_marketsnapshot_get_market_snapshot` |
| S4 | News / Sentiment / Attribution | Event or reason focus (coin optional) | why pumping, dumping, up, down, reason, catalyst, news, narrative, sentiment, event, what happened, rebound, recovery | `news_events_get_latest_events`, `news_feed_search_news`, `news_feed_get_social_sentiment`, `news_events_get_event_detail` (conditional), `info_onchain_get_token_onchain` (conditional) |
| S5 | Security / Risk | Contract security / scam-risk focus; **or** the user’s wording (any language) **semantically** expresses **long-term holding** of the token(s) under discussion, **or** **coin selection** (choosing / comparing which coin(s) to favor). Use **intent semantics**, not a fixed keyword list. **Do not** treat a bare English "long-term" **by itself** as sufficient for the long-term-holding branch without clearer hold / selection intent. | **Security**: safe, risk, contract security, honeypot, rug, scam, audit, trustworthy, screen, token risk, due diligence · **Long-term / selection**: infer meaning from context — **no** closed keyword list | `info_compliance_check_token_security`, `info_coin_get_coin_info` |

**Fallback rules** (when no signal is explicitly activated):
- `symbols == 0` -> activate S1 (market overview)
- `symbols == 1` -> activate S2 + S3 (single-coin comprehensive = fundamentals + technicals)
- `symbols >= 2` -> activate S2 x N (multi-coin comparison)
- `symbols >= 2` **and** the user **semantically** asks for a **comprehensive / holistic** multi-coin view (same spirit as single-coin S2+S3) -> also activate **S3 x N** (i.e. S2 x N + S3 x N)

**Screening mode** (when `symbols == 0` and the query contains screening cues — e.g. filter, find, recommend, which, ranking, top, screen, pick, best, shortlist, highest potential):
- Phase 1: Activate S1 to fetch top-coin snapshots
- LLM intermediate aggregation: Extract symbols from Phase 1 results
- Phase 2: Activate S2/S3/S4/S5 per remaining signal keywords

Key data to extract:
- `symbols[]`: List of coin tickers
- `sector`: Sector filter if any
- `time_range`: Time scope
- `activated_signals[]`: List of activated signal dimensions (S1-S5)
- `screening_mode`: Boolean

**Signal Routing Examples** (English phrasing; same routing logic applies to equivalent questions in any language):

| User Query (example) | symbols | Activated Signals | Explanation |
|----------------------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| "How is BTC doing?" | [BTC] | S2 + S3 (fallback) | No explicit dimension keywords; fallback: single-coin comprehensive |
| "Show me DOT support and resistance" | [DOT] | S3 | Support / resistance wording triggers Technicals |
| "DOT support levels plus the latest news" | [DOT] | S3 + S4 | Technicals + News dual activation |
| "Why did the market crash yesterday?" | [] | S4 + S1 | Why / crash triggers S4; market context triggers S1 |
| "Is sentiment recovering?" | [] | S4 (+ S1 if "market" scope) | Recovery / sentiment triggers S4; add S1 if query is market-wide |
| "Is ADA safe?" | [ADA] | S5 | Safety wording triggers Security |
| "Full weekend research report on XRP — price, news, and risk" | [XRP] | S2 + S3 + S4 + S5 | Full research report implies all dimensions |
| "Compare BTC, ETH, and SOL" | [BTC,ETH,SOL] | S2 x 3 (fallback) | Multi-coin, no extra keywords; fallback: comparison |
| "Comprehensive comparison of BTC, ETH, and SOL" | [BTC,ETH,SOL] | S2 x 3 + S3 x 3 | Comprehensive multi-coin -> stack technicals per coin |
| "Long-term hold: compare BTC, ETH, and SOL holistically" | [BTC,ETH,SOL] | S2 x 3 + S3 x 3 + S5 x 3 | Long-term selection + holistic view often implies fundamentals + technicals + risk |
| "Daily market brief — majors, hot sectors, drivers, and tomorrow's outlook" | [] | S1 + S4 + S3(BTC) | Macro brief + causes + outlook -> S1, S4, optional S3 for trend |
| "Screen the top 5 gainers today and analyze the most promising one" | [] | S1 -> S2 + S3 (screening) | Screening + top gainers / potential -> P1 snapshots, P2 deep dive on picked symbol |
| "Why is DeFi up? Leader coin fundamentals and technicals" | [] (+ sector) | S1 + S4 -> S2 + S3 | Sector + why -> S1/S4 then leader symbol -> S2 + S3 |
| "Which coins are oversold? Pick two and analyze them" | [] | S1 -> S3 + S2 (screening) | Open-ended which + oversold/overbought + pick -> screening; P2 S3 + S2 |
| "Check ADA token risk and fundamentals" | [ADA] | S5 + S2 | Due diligence + token safety + fundamentals -> S5 + S2 |

### Step 3: Assemble Tool Set & Execute

Combine all activated signal tool sets into a union, deduplicate by tool name + parameters, then execute:

**Parallel execution** (tools within the same Phase have no dependencies — call simultaneously):
- All tools in a Phase are dispatched in parallel.

**Serial dependencies** (next Phase depends on previous Phase LLM aggregation):
- Screening mode: Phase 1 snapshot results -> LLM extracts symbols -> Phase 2 uses those symbols.
- Attribution branch (S4): `news_events_get_latest_events` result determines whether to call `news_events_get_event_detail` (event found) or skip (no event).

**Deduplication rule**: Same tool + same parameters within one request is called only once; the result is reused across multiple aggregation steps.

Call each activated tool with the parameter conventions below:

Call `info_marketsnapshot_get_market_snapshot` with: `symbol={symbol}, timeframe="1d", source="spot"`
Call `info_coin_get_coin_info` with: `query={symbol}, scope="full"`
Call `info_markettrend_get_kline` with: `symbol={symbol}, timeframe="1d", limit=90, source="spot"`
Call `info_markettrend_get_indicator_history` with: `symbol={symbol}, indicators=["rsi","macd","bollinger","ma"]`
Call `info_markettrend_get_technical_analysis` with: `symbol={symbol}`
Call `info_platformmetrics_get_defi_overview` with: `category="all"`
Call `info_compliance_check_token_security` with: `token={symbol}, chain={chain}`
Call `info_onchain_get_token_onchain` with: `token={symbol}`
Call `news_events_get_latest_events` with: `time_range={time_range}, limit=10`
Call `news_events_get_event_detail` with: `event_id={event_id}`
Call `news_feed_search_news` with: `coin={symbol}, limit=5, sort_by="importance"`
Call `news_feed_get_social_sentiment` with: `coin={symbol}`

Key data to extract:
- `tool_results{}`: Map of tool name to response data
- `failed_tools[]`: Tools that timed out or returned errors

### Step 4: LLM Multi-Source Aggregation

Pass all tool responses to the LLM for aggregation:

1. **Merge** data from all dimensions into a coherent narrative.
2. **Deduplicate** overlapping information (e.g., price from multiple snapshot calls).
3. **Conflict resolution**: If sources contradict each other, present both viewpoints with attribution — never merge contradictory conclusions into one sentence.
4. **Data timestamp**: Label each data point with its approximate data time (e.g., "as of 2026-03-21 12:00 UTC"). Do NOT include internal tool names or API field names in the output.
5. **Missing data**: If a tool failed or returned empty, annotate "Data unavailable for this section" — never fabricate data.

Key data to extract:
- `aggregated_report`: Structured report content
- `data_sources[]`: List of tools that contributed data
- `data_timestamps`: Approximate data freshness

### Step 5: Output Structured Report

Select the appropriate report template based on the activated signals, then output the final report. Always include the disclaimer at the end.

Key data to extract:
- `final_report`: Markdown string — user-facing report body (template-filled; may refine `aggregated_report` from Step 4); must include the standard disclaimer.

## Judgment Logic Summary

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| User intent is "execute" (buy/sell/swap/stake) | Route to appropriate trading skill; do NOT enter this Skill |
| User mentions DEX / on-chain address / liquidity pool | Route to `gate-dex-market` or DEX-related skill |
| No symbols and no explicit dimension keywords | Fallback: activate S1 (market overview) |
| 1 symbol and no explicit dimension keywords | Fallback: activate S2 + S3 (single-coin comprehensive) |
| 2+ symbols and no explicit dimension keywords | Fallback: activate S2 x N (multi-coin comparison) |
| 2+ symbols and user semantically asks for comprehensive/holistic multi-coin analysis (same intent may be expressed in any language) | Activate S2 x N + S3 x N |
| Symbols == 0 + screening keywords (filter/find/top/which) | Enter screening mode: S1 in P1 -> extract symbols -> targeted signals in P2 |
| Query contains "research report" or "full report" | Activate all signals: S2 + S3 + S4 + S5 |
| A single tool times out or returns empty | Skip that dimension; annotate "Data unavailable" |
| All tools fail | Return error; suggest retry later |
| `info_markettrend_get_kline` returns abnormal prices | Likely missing `source=spot` constraint; retry with parameter |
| User asks "analyze then buy" | Complete research (this Skill) then route execution to trading skill |
| Contradictory data from multiple sources | Present both viewpoints with attribution; do not merge |

---

## Error Handling

| Error Type | Handling |
|------------|----------|
| Coin not found | Ask user to verify the coin name or ticker |
| Single tool timeout | Skip that dimension; note "This dimension is temporarily unavailable" |
| All tools fail | Return error message; suggest retry later |
| No Gate-News MCP configured | Use only Gate-Info tools (8 tools); mark news/sentiment sections as "No data" |
| No Gate-Info MCP configured | Critical — cannot proceed; guide user to install Gate-Info MCP |
| `info_onchain_get_token_onchain` returns empty | Expected for some tokens; skip on-chain section with note |
| `info_compliance_check_token_security` on BTC/ETH | Skip contract audit for major coins; note "Not applicable for native chain assets" |
| User asks about NFT / options / other uncovered categories | Explain coverage boundary; route to specialized skill if available |

---

## L1/L2 Routing Strategy

When a user query can be handled by a single L1 Skill's tool set (e.g., "How is BTC?" only needs coinanalysis's 5 tools), this L2 still serves as the unified entry point for all "research" intents:

- **Short-circuit optimization**: If the activated signals map to only one L1's tools, call only that subset and produce the report — no need to invoke all 12 tools.
- **Principle**: Unified entry via this L2 ensures consistent "research" experience; internally, 1 to 12 tools are called as needed.

### DEX / On-Chain Boundary Handling

This Skill uses only Gate-Info MCP and Gate-News MCP. It does **not** include `gate-dex-*` or on-chain address tracking capabilities.

| Situation | Detection Signal | Action |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| User mentions DEX explicitly | "DEX", "on-chain", "liquidity pool", "Uniswap", "wallet address" | Route to `gate-dex-market` or DEX skill; do NOT enter this Skill |
| Ambiguous "liquidity" without CEX/DEX context | "this coin's liquidity" | Default to CEX interpretation; if user clarifies DEX, re-route |
| User asks about NFT / options | "NFT", "options", "derivatives" | Explain coverage boundary; route to specialized skill if available |
| User asks "Is this coin listed on Gate?" | "listed", "can I buy" | Brief listing check + risk note; or route to listing/new-coin skill |
| Multi-language or mixed-language user input | N/A | Parse intent normally; if "research" intent with no DEX/execution signals, enter this Skill |

### No Confirmation Required

This L2 does **not** involve any trading confirmation mechanism because:

- All 12 Tool Calls are **read-only queries** (`info_*` / `news_*`); zero `cex_*` write operations
- No asset changes, order placement, transfers, or mode switches
- No API Key / Secret / OAuth2 required

If the user appends execution intent (e.g., "analyze then buy"), this Skill completes the research phase only. The execution phase is routed to the appropriate trading skill (e.g., `gate-exchange-spot`), which applies its own Action Draft -> User Confirm -> Execute flow.

### Tool Degradation Matrix

| Tool | Degradation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| `info_onchain_get_token_onchain` | Some tokens return empty; skip on-chain section and annotate "On-chain data unavailable" |
| `info_compliance_check_token_security` | Requires `chain` parameter; skip for major coins (BTC/ETH); annotate "Not applicable for native chain assets" |
| `news_events_get_event_detail` | Depends on `event_id` from P1; if no events in P1, skip (go to P2b branch) |
| `info_marketsnapshot_get_market_snapshot` | If timeout, retry once; if still fails, skip snapshot section |
| Any other tool | Single tool failure: skip that dimension, annotate "This dimension is temporarily unavailable" |
| All tools | If all tools fail: return error message, suggest retry later |

---

## Cross-Skill Routing

| User Follow-up Intent | Route To |
|-----------------------|----------|
| "Buy it" / "Place an order" | `gate-exchange-spot` |
| "Open a futures position" | `gate-exchange-futures` |
| "Swap it" | `gate-exchange-flashswap` |
| "Stake it" | `gate-exchange-staking` or `gate-exchange-simpleearn` |
| "Check my assets" | `gate-exchange-assets` |
| "Track this wallet address" | `gate-info-addresstracker` |
| "Show DEX data" | `gate-dex-market` |

## Safety Rules

1. **No investment advice**: All output is data-driven analysis. Every report must include the disclaimer: "does not constitute investment advice."
2. **No price predictions**: Do not output specific target prices or directional predictions (e.g., "will reach $100K").
3. **No fund operations**: This Skill calls only read-only `info_*` and `news_*` tools. Never call `cex_*` tools.
4. **Data transparency**: Label approximate data time for each section (e.g., "Data as of ..."). Use natural-language source labels (e.g., "Gate market data", "Gate news") instead of internal tool names or API field names. Never expose `info_*`, `news_*`, `cex_*` tool identifiers or raw JSON field names (e.g., `snapshot_time`, `total_defi_tvl`) in user-facing output.
5. **No data fabrication**: When a tool returns empty or fails, clearly state "Data unavailable" — never fabricate numbers.
6. **Conflict disclosure**: When sources contradict, present both sides with attribution rather than silently picking one.
7. **No auth required**: All 12 tools are public read-only; no API Key or OAuth2 is needed.
8. **No internal identifiers in output**: The final user-facing report must NOT contain any internal tool names (e.g., `info_marketsnapshot_get_market_snapshot`, `news_events_get_latest_events`), API field names (e.g., `snapshot_time`, `total_defi_tvl`, `total_liquidation_24h`, `market_cap`), or MCP service prefixes (`info_*`, `news_*`, `cex_*`). Present all data using natural-language descriptions only. Tool names and field names are internal orchestration details — they must never leak into the report.
9. **Age restriction**: This skill is intended for users aged 18 or above with full civil capacity, consistent with Gate's platform requirements.
10. **Data flow declaration**: All data flows exclusively through Gate MCP to Gate API. No user data is transmitted to third parties.
