## Authentication

### Credential Check (Before Any Private API Call)

Before calling any authenticated endpoint, verify credentials are available:

1. Check for environment variables:
   - `BITMART_API_KEY` — API key
   - `BITMART_API_SECRET` — Secret key
   - `BITMART_API_MEMO` — Memo string
2. Or check for config file: `~/.bitmart/config.toml`
   ```toml
   [default]
   api_key = "your-api-key"
   api_secret = "your-secret-key"
   memo = "your-memo"
   ```
3. If missing: **STOP**. Guide user to set up credentials. Do NOT proceed with any authenticated call.

**Key display rules:** When displaying credentials back to the user, show only the first 5 and last 4 characters (e.g., `bmk12...9xyz`). NEVER display full secret or memo values.

### Auth Levels

| Level | When | Headers Required |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| **NONE** | Public market data (endpoints 1-9) | None |
| **KEYED** | Read-only private data — balances, fees, margin account, borrow/repay records (endpoints 10-17) | `X-BM-KEY` |
| **SIGNED** | Write operations and order queries (endpoints 18-32) | `X-BM-KEY` + `X-BM-SIGN` + `X-BM-TIMESTAMP` |

### Signature Generation

```
timestamp = current UTC time in milliseconds
message   = "{timestamp}#{memo}#{request_body_json}"
signature = HMAC-SHA256(secret_key, message) → hex string
```

- For **POST** requests: `request_body_json` is the JSON body string.
- For **GET** requests: `request_body_json` is an empty string `""`.

### Required Headers (SIGNED)

| Header | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `X-BM-KEY` | API key |
| `X-BM-SIGN` | Hex-encoded HMAC-SHA256 signature |
| `X-BM-TIMESTAMP` | Current UTC timestamp in milliseconds |
| `User-Agent` | `bitmart-skills/spot/v2026.3.23` — identifies requests from this skill for analytics |

See `references/authentication.md` for full setup guide and troubleshooting.

## API Base

- **Base URL**: `https://api-cloud.bitmart.com`
- **Symbol Format**: `BTC_USDT` (base_quote, underscore separated)

## Standard Response Format

**Success:**
```json
{
  "code": 1000,
  "message": "OK",
  "trace": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

**Error:**
```json
{
  "code": 50000,
  "message": "Bad Request",
  "trace": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "data": null
}
```

**Important:** `code == 1000` means success. Any other code is an error.
**Important:** Spot business error codes are endpoint/version specific. Do **not** assume the same numeric code has the same meaning across all spot flows.

**GET requests:** Parameters go in the query string.
**POST requests:** Parameters go in the JSON body.

**Rate limit response headers:**
- `X-BM-RateLimit-Remaining` — Number of requests already used in the current window
- `X-BM-RateLimit-Limit` — Maximum allowed requests in the current window
- `X-BM-RateLimit-Reset` — Current time window length (seconds)

**Warning:** If `X-BM-RateLimit-Remaining >= X-BM-RateLimit-Limit`, stop calling immediately and wait for reset to avoid sending one extra over-limit request.

If rate limited (HTTP 429), wait for the reset period before retrying.

## Quickstart

### Example 1: Get BTC price (no auth)

```bash
curl -s -H "User-Agent: bitmart-skills/spot/v2026.3.23" 'https://api-cloud.bitmart.com/spot/quotation/v3/ticker?symbol=BTC_USDT'
```

### Example 2: Get account balance (KEYED)

```bash
curl -s -H "X-BM-KEY: $BITMART_API_KEY" \
  -H "User-Agent: bitmart-skills/spot/v2026.3.23" \
  'https://api-cloud.bitmart.com/account/v1/wallet'
```

### Example 3: Place limit buy order (SIGNED)

```bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%s000)
BODY='{"symbol":"BTC_USDT","side":"buy","type":"limit","size":"0.001","price":"60000"}'
SIGN=$(echo -n "${TIMESTAMP}#${BITMART_API_MEMO}#${BODY}" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$BITMART_API_SECRET" | awk '{print $NF}')
curl -s -X POST 'https://api-cloud.bitmart.com/spot/v2/submit_order' \
  -H "User-Agent: bitmart-skills/spot/v2026.3.23" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-BM-KEY: $BITMART_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-BM-SIGN: $SIGN" \
  -H "X-BM-TIMESTAMP: $TIMESTAMP" \
  -d "$BODY"
```

## API Reference

See `references/api-reference.md` for full endpoint documentation with parameters, examples, and response formats.
See `references/scenarios.md` for step-by-step execution flows for common spot tasks such as market buy, limit sell, batch orders, and cancel-replace.

---

## Reference: Order Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `limit` | Execute at specified price or better |
| `market` | Execute immediately at best available price |
| `limit_maker` | Post-only; rejected if it would immediately match (ensures maker fee) |
| `ioc` | Immediate-or-cancel; unfilled portion is canceled immediately |

## Reference: Order Sides

| Side | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `buy` | Buy base currency with quote currency |
| `sell` | Sell base currency for quote currency |

## Reference: Order States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `new` | Order accepted, not yet filled |
| `partially_filled` | Partially executed, still open |
| `filled` | Fully executed |
| `canceled` | Canceled by user |
| `partially_canceled` | Partially filled, then canceled |

## Reference: Cancel Sources

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `""` (empty) | Not canceled |
| `user` | Canceled by user |
| `system` | Canceled by system (e.g., insufficient balance) |
| `stp` | Canceled by self-trade prevention |

## Reference: STP Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `none` | No self-trade prevention |
| `cancel_maker` | Cancel the resting (maker) order if self-trade detected |
| `cancel_taker` | Cancel the incoming (taker) order if self-trade detected |

## Reference: Trade Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `taker` | Order matched immediately against resting order |
| `maker` | Order rested on book and was matched later |

## Reference: Parameter Naming Convention

> **CRITICAL — Wrong case = silently ignored field.** The API does NOT return an error for misnamed params; it simply ignores them, causing unexpected behavior or wrong results. Always verify the endpoint version before constructing any request body.

| API Version | Convention | Examples |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| v1-v3 | snake_case | `client_order_id`, `order_id`, `start_time` |
| v4 | camelCase | `clientOrderId`, `orderId`, `orderMode`, `startTime` |

**Mixed-case exceptions (must be memorized):**
- `POST /spot/v2/submit_order`: `stpMode` (camelCase) alongside `client_order_id` (snake_case)
- `POST /spot/v1/margin/submit_order`: `clientOrderId` (camelCase in a v1 endpoint)

## Reference: K-Line Steps

| Step (minutes) | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | 1-minute candles |
| 5 | 5-minute candles |
| 15 | 15-minute candles |
| 30 | 30-minute candles |
| 60 | 1-hour candles |
| 120 | 2-hour candles |
| 240 | 4-hour candles |
| 1440 | 1-day candles |
| 10080 | 1-week candles |
| 43200 | 1-month candles |

## Operation Flow

### Step 0: Credential Check

Verify `BITMART_API_KEY`, `BITMART_API_SECRET`, and `BITMART_API_MEMO` are available via environment variables or `~/.bitmart/config.toml`. If missing, STOP and guide the user to set up credentials.

### Step 1: Identify User Intent

Parse user request and map to a READ or WRITE operation:

- **READ** operations: market data, balance queries, order queries, fee rates
- **WRITE** operations: place order, cancel order, batch orders

### Timestamp Display Rules

API responses contain Unix timestamps in different units. When displaying any timestamp to the user, **always convert to human-readable local time**.

| Field | Unit | Conversion |
|-------|------|------------|
| `createTime`, `updateTime` (order responses) | Milliseconds | `÷ 1000` → Unix seconds → local time |
| `server_time` (system time) | Milliseconds | `÷ 1000` → Unix seconds → local time |
| `t` (K-line candle open time) | Seconds | Direct → Unix seconds → local time |
| `create_time` (borrow records) | Seconds | Direct → Unix seconds → local time |
| `repay_time` (repay records) | Seconds | Direct → Unix seconds → local time |

**Display format:** `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in the user's local timezone. Example: timestamp `1700000000000` (ms) → `2023-11-15 06:13:20` (UTC+8).

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Do NOT treat millisecond timestamps as seconds (produces dates in year 55000+)
- Do NOT display raw numeric timestamps — always convert to readable format
- Do NOT assume UTC — convert to the user's local timezone

### Step 2: Execute

- **READ**: Call the API endpoint, parse response, format data for user display.
- **WRITE**: Follow these sub-steps strictly in order:

  **2a. Parameter naming check (prevents silent failures):**
  - Identify the API version of the target endpoint
  - v4 endpoints (`/spot/v4/...`): ALL params must be **camelCase** (`clientOrderId`, `orderId`, `orderMode`, `startTime`)
  - v1–v3 endpoints: ALL params must be **snake_case** (`client_order_id`, `order_id`, `start_time`)
  - Special exception: `POST /spot/v2/submit_order` uses **mixed** — `client_order_id` (snake_case) + `stpMode` (camelCase)
  - The API does NOT return an error for wrong-case params — it silently ignores them, causing wrong orders or failed queries

  **2b. Order type rules — params, precision, minimum validation:**

  First call `GET /spot/v1/symbols/details`, locate the symbol in `data.symbols[]`, extract: `price_max_precision`, `quote_increment`, `min_buy_amount`, `min_sell_amount`.

  Then branch:

  **`type=market`, `side=buy` — Market buy:**
  - Send only `notional` (USDT/quote amount). Do NOT send `size` or `price` — silently ignored and causes error 50021.
  - Validate: `float(notional) >= min_buy_amount`. If not, STOP — suggest `"notional":"<min_buy_amount>"`. API returns 51012 otherwise.
  - Body: `{"symbol":"XRP_USDT","side":"buy","type":"market","notional":"5"}`

  **`type=market`, `side=sell` — Market sell:**
  - Send only `size` (base currency quantity, e.g. XRP amount). Do NOT send `price` or `notional`.
  - Truncate `size` to `quote_increment` precision.
  - Estimate value: `size * current_last_price`. If estimated value `< min_sell_amount`, STOP and warn user.
  - Body: `{"symbol":"XRP_USDT","side":"sell","type":"market","size":"10"}`

  **`type=limit` — Limit order:**
  - Send `size` + `price`. Truncate `price` to `price_max_precision`, `size` to `quote_increment`.
  - **Note:** If price exceeds `price_max_precision`, the API silently truncates the extra decimals instead of returning an error. Always truncate client-side to ensure the submitted price matches the intended price.
  - Calculate `order_value = size * price`. If `order_value < min_buy_amount` (buy) or `< min_sell_amount` (sell), STOP.
  - If user requested "buy all" / "use full balance": `size = floor(balance / price)` at precision, re-verify minimum.
  - **No hidden risk** — order sits on the book until filled or canceled.

  **`type=limit_maker` — Post-only (maker-only):**
  - Same params as `limit` (`size` + `price`). Same precision/minimum rules.
  - **CRITICAL behavioral note:** The server **auto-cancels** the order (no error) if the price would immediately match:
    - Buy `limit_maker`: if `price >= best_ask`, order is silently canceled. Price must be **below** best ask.
    - Sell `limit_maker`: if `price <= best_bid`, order is silently canceled. Price must be **above** best bid.
  - Inform user of this risk when setting an aggressive `limit_maker` price.

  **`type=ioc` — Immediate-or-Cancel:**
  - Same params as `limit` (`size` + `price`). Same precision/minimum rules.
  - **Behavioral note:** Fills whatever quantity is available immediately at the given price; the unfilled remainder is **immediately canceled**. User may receive a partial fill or no fill at all.

  **2c. Confirm and execute:**
  - Present order summary based on type:
    - market buy: symbol, side=buy, type=market, notional amount
    - market sell: symbol, side=sell, type=market, size (quantity)
    - limit/limit_maker/ioc: symbol, side, type, size, price, estimated order value
  - For `limit_maker`: include a reminder that the order will be auto-canceled if the price crosses the spread.
  - Ask for explicit **"CONFIRM"** before executing. Only proceed after user confirms.

### Step 3: Verify (WRITE only)

- After **placing an order**: Call `POST /spot/v4/query/order` with `{"orderId":"..."}` to confirm order status.
- After **canceling an order**: Call `POST /spot/v4/query/open-orders` to verify the order is no longer open.
- Report the verified result to the user.

## Cross-Skill Workflows

### Workflow 1: Check Price → Check Balance → Buy

1. **bitmart-exchange-spot** → `GET /spot/quotation/v3/ticker?symbol=BTC_USDT` — Get current price
2. **bitmart-exchange-spot** → `GET /account/v1/wallet` — Check available balance
3. **bitmart-exchange-spot** → `POST /spot/v2/submit_order` — Place buy order (after user CONFIRM)
4. **bitmart-exchange-spot** → `POST /spot/v4/query/order` — Verify order execution

---

## Error Handling

Spot business error codes are endpoint/version specific. Use the table below for authentication / transport issues and common current spot order-query behavior. For margin borrow / repay / transfer flows, see the margin-only notes after the table.

| Code | Description | Action |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1000 | Success | Process response normally |
| 30002 | X-BM-KEY not found | Check that API key is set correctly |
| 30005 | X-BM-SIGN is wrong | Verify signature generation (timestamp, memo, body format) |
| 30006 | X-BM-TIMESTAMP is wrong | Ensure `X-BM-TIMESTAMP` is present and is a Unix timestamp in milliseconds |
| 30007 | Timestamp/recvWindow validation failed | Sync system clock (NTP), send `X-BM-TIMESTAMP` as Unix milliseconds, and ensure `(serverTime - timestamp) <= recvWindow`; `recvWindow` must be Long in `(0,60000]`, default `5000` (max `60000`). For current signed v4 flows, rely on `recvWindow` as the effective request-validity window. |
| 30010 | IP forbidden | Check API key IP whitelist settings |
| 30013 | Rate limit exceeded | Wait for rate limit window to reset, then retry |
| 50005 | Order Id not found / query returned no data | On `POST /spot/v4/query/order`, a missing `orderId` / `clientOrderId` currently returns this code |
| 50021 | param error | For `market` buy, use `notional` (USDT amount) — do NOT use `size`; `size` is silently ignored and causes this error |
| 51011 | param not match : size * price >= X | Read symbol constraints from `GET /spot/v1/symbols/details`; enforce side-specific minimum notional (`min_buy_amount`/`min_sell_amount`) |
| 51012 | below minimum order amount | `notional` (for market buy) or `size * price` (for limit) is below `min_buy_amount`; increase order value to at least the symbol minimum |
| 52000 | Unsupported OrderMode Type | On current v4 query endpoints, use a valid `orderMode` (`spot` / `iso_margin`) or omit the field to query all modes |
| 40044 | Invalid order size | Call `GET /spot/v1/symbols/details`; use symbol precision/increment fields and truncate (not round) `size` and `price` |
| 50023 | Operation is limited | Pair may not support API trading; use a different pair |
| 429 | HTTP rate limit | Back off exponentially, check `X-BM-RateLimit-Reset` header |
| 418 | IP banned | Stop all requests immediately; wait before retrying |

**Margin-only business codes (do not treat as global spot codes):**
- `51003` — `Account Limit`. Use in margin borrow / repay / transfer context; do **not** use as the generic “order not found” code for v4 order-query flows.
- `51006` — `Exceeds the amount to be repaid`. Use for isolated margin repay flows.
- `51007` — `order_mode not found` in the official business-code table. Do **not** use this as guidance for current v4 query endpoints; invalid `orderMode` requests currently return `52000`.
| 403 | Cloudflare WAF block | Check IP reputation (VPN/cloud IPs are commonly challenged); wait 30-60 seconds and retry; do not auto-retry more than 3 times |
| 503 | Cloudflare challenge / origin unavailable | Same as 403; if response body contains "Cloudflare" or "cf-", it is a Cloudflare interception, not a BitMart error; check network environment |

### Cloudflare Handling

BitMart API is behind Cloudflare CDN. If you receive HTTP 403/503 and the response body contains "Cloudflare", "cf-", or an HTML challenge page (instead of JSON):

1. This is a Cloudflare interception, not a BitMart API error — do not parse as JSON
2. Check if too many requests were sent in a short window (Cloudflare WAF has its own rules independent of API rate limits)
3. Wait 30-60 seconds before retrying
4. If running from a cloud server or VPN, the IP may have low reputation — try from a different network
5. Do not auto-retry more than 3 times — inform the user if the issue persists

> **Cloudflare 1010:** Non-curl HTTP clients with default bot-like User-Agent strings (e.g., `Python-urllib`, `Go-http-client`) may receive HTTP 403 / error 1010. Always send the `User-Agent: bitmart-skills/spot/v2026.3.23` header from your HTTP library — do not rely on the library default.

---

## Security Notes

- **Never display full API keys or secrets.** Show first 5 + last 4 characters only (e.g., `bmk12...9xyz`).
- **All WRITE operations require explicit user confirmation** before execution. Present a clear summary of the action and wait for "CONFIRM".
- **Recommend IP whitelist** on API keys for additional security.
- **Recommend minimum permissions:** Read-Only + Spot-Trade only (no Withdraw permission).
- **All trading outputs include disclaimer:** "Not financial advice. You are solely responsible for your investment decisions."
