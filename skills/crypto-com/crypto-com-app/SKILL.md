# Skill: crypto-com-app

## Agent Capability Requirements

This skill requires your agent platform to support the following capabilities. If your platform lacks any **required** capability, the skill will not function.

| Capability | Required | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Shell command execution** | Yes | Must be able to run `npx tsx ./scripts/...` and capture stdout |
| **Environment variables** | Yes | Must read `CDC_API_KEY` and `CDC_API_SECRET` from the shell environment |
| **JSON parsing** | Yes | Must parse structured JSON from script stdout to extract fields |
| **Multi-turn conversation** | Yes | Trading uses a quote → confirm flow that spans multiple user turns |
| **Persistent memory** | No | Used for `confirmation_required` preference. If unsupported, default to always confirming trades |
| **Elapsed-time awareness** | No | Used to check quote expiry (`countdown` field). If unsupported, always attempt confirmation and handle `invalid_quotation` errors gracefully |

## CRITICAL: How This Skill Works

**You MUST use the TypeScript scripts for ALL API interactions. NEVER call the API directly with `curl`, `fetch`, or any other HTTP method.**

The scripts handle request signing, error handling, and response formatting. If you bypass them:
- The request will fail (missing HMAC signature)
- The response won't be filtered or structured

**For every user request, find the matching command below and run it via `npx tsx`. Read the JSON output. Act on it.**

## Configurations
- BASE_URL: `https://wapi.crypto.com`
- CDC_API_KEY: `{{env.CDC_API_KEY}}`
- CDC_API_SECRET: `{{env.CDC_API_SECRET}}`
- CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED: `{{memory.confirmation_required}}` (Default: true)
- SKILL_DIR: The directory containing this `SKILL.md` file. Resolve it from the path you loaded this file from (e.g. if you read `/home/user/skills/crypto-com-app/SKILL.md`, then `SKILL_DIR` is `/home/user/skills/crypto-com-app`).

## Environment Setup
- Both `CDC_API_KEY` and `CDC_API_SECRET` must be set as environment variables before use.
- **Before running any script**, check whether both variables are set by running:
  ```bash
  echo "CDC_API_KEY=${CDC_API_KEY:+set}" "CDC_API_SECRET=${CDC_API_SECRET:+set}"
  ```
  If either prints empty instead of `set`, prompt the user:
  > "Your API credentials are not configured. Please set them in your terminal before I can proceed:
  > ```
  > export CDC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
  > export CDC_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"
  > ```
  > You can generate an API key at https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/13843786-api-key-management.
  > Let me know once you've set them."
  
  Then **stop and wait** for the user to confirm before retrying.
- If a script returns a `MISSING_ENV` error, treat it the same way: prompt the user to set the variables and wait.

## Script Commands

**ALL API interactions MUST go through these scripts.** They handle signing, execution, filtering, and error formatting. Run the appropriate command below via shell, then parse the JSON output.

**Prerequisite:** `npx tsx` (Node.js 18+ required; `tsx` is fetched automatically by `npx`).

**Important:** All script paths below use `$SKILL_DIR` as a placeholder for this skill's root directory. Resolve it from the path you loaded this SKILL.md from, or `cd` into the skill directory and use `./scripts/...` as the path. Either approach works.

### Account Commands

```bash
# Filtered non-zero balances (scope: fiat | crypto | all)
npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/account.ts balances [fiat|crypto|all]

# Single token balance lookup
npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/account.ts balance <SYMBOL>

# Weekly trading limit
npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/account.ts trading-limit

# Find funded source wallets for a trade type
npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/account.ts resolve-source <purchase|sale|exchange>

# Kill switch — revoke API key
npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/account.ts revoke-key
```

### Trade Commands

Trading follows a **two-step flow**: get a quotation first, then confirm the order.

```bash
# Step 1 — Get quotation (type: purchase | sale | exchange)
npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/trade.ts quote <type> '<json-params>'
# Returns: {"ok": true, "data": {"id": "<quotation-id>", "from_amount": {...}, "to_amount": {...}, "countdown": 15, ...}}

# Step 2 — Confirm order: pass the data.id from Step 1 as <quotation-id>
npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/trade.ts confirm <type> <quotation-id>

# View recent transactions
npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/trade.ts history
```

**How to map user intent to trade type:**

| User says | Trade type | From | To |
|-----------|-----------|------|-----|
| "Buy CRO with 100 USD" | `purchase` | USD (fiat) | CRO (crypto) |
| "Sell 0.1 BTC" | `sale` | BTC (crypto) | USD (fiat) |
| "Swap 0.1 BTC to ETH" | `exchange` | BTC (crypto) | ETH (crypto) |

**Quotation JSON params by trade type:**

| Type | JSON fields |
|------|------------|
| purchase | `{"from_currency":"USD","to_currency":"CRO","from_amount":"100"}` or use `to_amount` instead |
| sale | `{"from_currency":"BTC","to_currency":"USD","from_amount":"0.1","fixed_side":"from"}` |
| exchange | `{"from_currency":"BTC","to_currency":"ETH","from_amount":"0.1","side":"buy"}` |

**Example — "Buy CRO with 100 USD":**

1. Run: `npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/trade.ts quote purchase '{"from_currency":"USD","to_currency":"CRO","from_amount":"100"}'`
2. Read `data.id`, `data.from_amount`, `data.to_amount`, `data.countdown` from the response.
3. **If confirmation required** (default): Ask user "Confirm: 100 USD for X CRO? Valid for {countdown}s. Reply 'YES' to proceed."
   - If user says YES (within countdown): `npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/trade.ts confirm purchase <data.id>`
4. **If confirmation opted out** (`memory.confirmation_required` is `false`): Skip asking and immediately run `npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/trade.ts confirm purchase <data.id>`

**Opt-in / Opt-out:** Users can say "stop asking for confirmation" to auto-execute trades, or "require confirmation" to re-enable the prompt. See Section 3 below.

### Coin Discovery Commands

```bash
# Search coins
npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/coins.ts search '{"keyword":"BTC","sort_by":"rank","sort_direction":"asc","native_currency":"USD","page_size":10}'
```

**Required JSON parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Allowed values |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| `sort_by` | string | `rank`, `market_cap`, `alphabetical`, `volume`, `performance` |
| `sort_direction` | string | `asc`, `desc` |
| `native_currency` | string | Uppercase currency code (e.g. `USD`) |
| `keyword` | string | Search string, 1–100 chars; matches coin name and symbol only |
| `page_size` | integer | Number of results per page |

**Optional:** `page_token` — opaque token for fetching the next page (see pagination below).

**Pagination:** The response includes a `pagination` object with `has_more` (boolean) and `next_page_token` (string). When `has_more` is `true`, pass `next_page_token` as `page_token` in the next request to fetch the next page.

**Key response fields per coin:** `rails_id` (identical to `currency_id` / `currency` in trade and account APIs — use this to cross-reference), `price_native`, `price_usd`, `percent_change_*_native` (price performance over past timeframes, e.g. `percent_change_24h_native`).

### Output Format

Every script prints structured JSON to stdout:

**Success:**
```json
{"ok": true, "data": { ... }}
```

**Error:**
```json
{"ok": false, "error": "ERROR_CODE", "error_message": "Human-readable message"}
```

## Constraints
- **Validation:** Success requires `ok: true` in the script output.
- **Confirmation Window:** Quote validity is defined by the `countdown` field in the quotation data.
- **Execution Warning:** If order confirmation takes > 5s, notify: "Order submitted but taking longer than expected. Check order status with 'Show recent trades'".
- **Rate Limits:**
  - Max **10 trades per minute**.
  - Max **100 API calls per minute**.
  - On HTTP 429 (`RATE_LIMITED` error): wait **60 seconds** before retrying the same request. Inform the user: "Rate limit reached — please wait 60 seconds before trying again."

## Error Handling

All scripts return structured errors. Parse the `error` field to determine the appropriate response.

### Script Error Codes

These are the `error` values in the script's JSON output. They tell you *what category* of failure occurred.

| Error Code | Meaning | Agent Response |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| `MISSING_ENV` | `CDC_API_KEY` or `CDC_API_SECRET` not set | Tell user to set env vars via terminal |
| `API_ERROR` | API returned non-200 or `ok !== true` | Report: "Transaction failed: {error_message}" |
| `INVALID_ARGS` | Bad command-line arguments | Show correct usage from the `error_message` |
| `QUOTATION_FAILED` | Quotation request rejected by API | Report the `error_message` to user (see API errors below) |
| `EXECUTION_FAILED` | Order confirmation failed | Report and suggest: "Check order status with 'Show recent trades'" |
| `API_KEY_NOT_FOUND` | Key already revoked or does not exist | "API key not found — it may have already been revoked." |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | Too many requests (HTTP 429) | "Rate limit reached — please wait 60 seconds before trying again." |
| `UNKNOWN` | Unexpected error | Report the raw `error_message` |

**Rule:** When `ok` is `false` in the output, stop the current operation and report the error to the user using the guidance above. Never proceed to the next step after a failure.

### Common API Errors (Quick Reference)

These are the *specific* API error codes that appear inside the `error_message` of `QUOTATION_FAILED`, `EXECUTION_FAILED`, or `API_ERROR` responses. They tell you *why* the API rejected the request.

| `error` | Meaning | Recovery |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `not_enough_balance` | Insufficient funds | Check balances, reduce trade amount |
| `invalid_currency` | Currency code not recognized | Verify via coin search |
| `invalid_quotation` | Quote expired or already used | Request a new quotation |
| `failed_to_create_quotation` | Quotation engine error | Retry shortly |
| `not_eligible_for_prime` | Not eligible for Prime benefits | Proceed without Prime |
| `unauthorized` | Account not approved for trading | Contact support |
| `restricted_feature` | Feature restricted on account | Report `error_message` to user |
| `existing_currency_order_error` | An existing order is in progress | Wait or cancel existing order |
| `viban_purchase_not_enabled` | Fiat-to-crypto not enabled | Account feature not available |
| `crypto_viban_not_enabled` | Crypto-to-fiat not enabled | Account feature not available |
| `bank_transfer_not_enabled` | Bank transfer not enabled | Account feature not available |
| `missing_parameter` | Required parameter missing | Script bug — report it |
| `failed_to_create_transaction` | Transaction creation failed | Retry or contact support |
| `key_not_active` | API key revoked or expired | Generate a new API key, update env vars |
| `api_key_not_found` | Key doesn't exist or belongs to another user | Verify correct key is set in `CDC_API_KEY` |

For dynamic errors (limit exceeded, currency disabled, cooling-off, etc.), report the `error` and `error_message` directly to the user. For full details, see [references/errors.md](references/errors.md).

## Logic & Rules

### 1. Asset & Source Disambiguation

Determine the trade type first:
- **Purchase** — fiat → crypto
- **Sale** — crypto → fiat
- **Exchange** — crypto → crypto

Then resolve the source wallet:
- For **purchase**: run `npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/account.ts resolve-source purchase`. The script returns only funded fiat entries.
- For **sale** or **exchange**: run `npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/account.ts resolve-source sale` (or `exchange`). The script returns only funded crypto entries.

**Result (from `data.status`):**
- **`SELECTED`** → auto-select `data.currency`.
- **`AMBIGUOUS`** → prompt user to choose from `data.options`.
- **`EMPTY`** → inform user "No funded wallets found" and stop.

**"Sell All" Scenario:** If user says "Sell all [TOKEN]", run `npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/account.ts balance [TOKEN]`. Use the `data.available` amount (or `data.balance`) as `from_amount` for the quotation.

### 2. Trading Process (Quotation → Confirmation → Execution)

When the user asks to buy, sell, or swap crypto, **always** follow this three-step flow:

- **Step A — Get Quotation:** Build the JSON params from the user's request (see the "Quotation JSON params" table in Trade Commands) and run:
  `npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/trade.ts quote <type> '<json-params>'`
  Read `data.id`, `data.from_amount`, `data.to_amount`, and `data.countdown` from the response.

- **Step B — Ask User to Confirm:**
    - **IF** `memory.confirmation_required` is `true` (or unset):
        - Prompt: "Confirm: {from_amount} for {to_amount}? Valid for {countdown}s. Reply 'YES' to proceed."
        - **Expiration Logic:** If the user replies "YES" after `countdown` seconds have elapsed, reject: "Transaction rejected: The quotation rate has expired. Please request a new quote."
        - Execute Step C ONLY if user replies "YES" within the valid window.
    - **ELSE (Opted Out):**
        - Notify: "Quotation received. Proceeding to execution automatically..."
        - Immediately proceed to Step C.

- **Step C — Execute Order:** Run: `npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/trade.ts confirm <type> <data.id>` using the `id` from Step A.

### 3. Memory Management (Opt-in/Out)
- **To Opt-out:** If user says "stop asking for confirmation" or "enable auto-trade", update `memory.confirmation_required` to `false`.
- **To Opt-in:** If user says "require confirmation" or "enable manual trade", update `memory.confirmation_required` to `true`.
- **Platforms without persistent memory:** If your platform does not support `{{memory.*}}`, treat `confirmation_required` as always `true` (safest default).

### 4. Error Handling
- All script outputs include an `ok` field. Success is defined ONLY as `ok: true`.
- If `ok` is `false`, read `error` and respond per the Error Handling table above.
- Never proceed to the next step after a failed command.

### 5. Account & History
- **History:** Run `npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/trade.ts history` — display the entries from `data`.
- **Weekly Trading Limit:** Run `npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/account.ts trading-limit` — display as: "📊 Weekly Trading Limit: {data.used} / {data.limit} USD (Remaining: {data.remaining} USD)".
- **Balances (Categorized):**
    - If "List Fiat": run `npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/account.ts balances fiat`.
    - If "List Crypto": run `npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/account.ts balances crypto`.
    - If "List All": run `npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/account.ts balances all`. **Crucial:** Display Fiat category first, followed by Crypto balances below.
    - The scripts automatically filter out zero-balance entries. If a category has no entries in the output, display "No holdings" under that header.
    - **Crypto balances** (`data.crypto`) contain a `note` field ("available for trading") and a `wallets` array. Always clarify to the user that these amounts are what's available for trading — total holdings across all products may be higher.
    - **Portfolio Allocation:** When crypto balances are queried, the output may include a `portfolio_allocation` array — each entry has a product `name` and `price_native` (USD value). Display this as a summary of the user's asset distribution across products (e.g. Crypto Wallet, Exchange, Earn, Staking, etc.).
    - **Single token balance** (`balance <SYMBOL>`) output may include a `product_allocation` object — keys are product names (e.g. `crypto_earn`, `staking`, `supercharger`, `crypto_basket`, `airdrop_arena`) and values are the token amounts held in each. Only non-zero products are included. Summarize these allocations to the user alongside the available-for-trading amount so they see the full picture of where their tokens are held.

### 6. Kill Switch
- **Trigger:** User says "STOP ALL TRADING", "kill switch", or similar emergency stop command.
- **ALWAYS require explicit confirmation** regardless of `memory.confirmation_required`:
    - Prompt: "⚠️ WARNING: This will immediately revoke your API key and disable all trading. A new API key must be generated to resume. Type 'CONFIRM KILL SWITCH' to proceed."
    - Execute ONLY if user replies with the exact phrase.
- **Execution:** Run `npx tsx $SKILL_DIR/scripts/account.ts revoke-key`.
- **On success (`ok: true`):** Notify: "🛑 Kill switch activated. API key has been revoked. All trading is disabled. Generate a new API key and update your environment variables to resume."
- **On `API_KEY_NOT_FOUND` error:** Notify: "API key not found — it may have already been revoked or does not exist."
- **Idempotency:** Revoking an already-revoked key is not an error; treat it the same as a successful revocation.

### 7. Balance Display Format
- **Fiat Header:** "🏦 Fiat Balances"
- **Crypto Header:** "🪙 Crypto Balances"
- Always list Fiat section before Crypto section when both are requested.
- **Never display zero-balance assets.** Only show assets with a balance greater than 0. If all assets in a category are zero, show "No holdings" under that header.
