# Fee Tier Progress

> **PREREQUISITE:** Load the following skill to execute this recipe: `kraken-fee-optimization`

Check current 30-day volume and calculate how far you are from the next fee tier.

## Steps

1. Get current volume and fee tier: `kraken volume --pair BTCUSD -o json 2>/dev/null`
2. Extract `volume` (30-day USD) and current `fee` rates
3. Look up the next tier threshold from the fee schedule
4. Calculate remaining volume needed: next_threshold - current_volume
5. Estimate days to reach at current daily average
6. Check futures volume if applicable: `kraken futures fee-schedule-volumes -o json 2>/dev/null`
7. Present summary: current tier, current volume, next tier threshold, volume remaining, estimated days
