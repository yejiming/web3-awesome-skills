# OKX CEX Earn CLI

## Prerequisites

1. Install `okx` CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @okx_ai/okx-trade-cli
   ```
2. Configure credentials:
   ```bash
   okx config add-profile AK=<your_api_key> SK=<your_secret_key> PP=<your_passphrase> name=live
   # or interactive wizard:
   okx config init
   ```
3. Verify: `okx --profile live earn savings balance`

---

## Credential & Profile Check

Run `okx config show` before any authenticated command.

- Error or no configuration → **stop**, guide user to run `okx config init`, wait for completion.
- Credentials configured → proceed.

OKX Earn does not support demo mode. Always use `--profile live` silently — don't mention it unless there's an error.

**On 401 errors:** stop immediately, tell the user their credentials may be invalid or expired, guide them to update `~/.okx/config.toml` (do NOT ask them to paste credentials into chat), then verify with `okx config show` and retry.

## Operation Flow

### Step 0 — Credential & Profile Check

Before any authenticated command: see [Credential & Profile Check](#credential--profile-check). Always use `--profile live` silently.

### Step 1 — Identify earn intent

**Simple Earn / On-chain Earn:**
- Query balance / history / rates → READ command, proceed directly.
- Subscribe / redeem / set-rate / on-chain purchase → WRITE command, go to Step 2.

When user asks to view "earn positions" or "赚币持仓" (regardless of whether they mention DCD explicitly), query all three simultaneously:

```bash
okx --profile live earn savings balance --json    # Simple Earn
okx --profile live earn onchain orders --json     # On-chain Earn
okx --profile live earn dcd orders --json         # Dual Investment (双币赢)
```

Only present sections that have actual holdings. For DCD: translate state codes using the table in `{baseDir}/references/dcd-commands.md`.

**Dual Investment (DCD / 双币赢):**
- Browse products / pairs → READ; when user specifies a currency, read `{baseDir}/references/workflows.md` (DCD browse flow) for the mandatory parallel pre-fetch before rendering the product table
- Subscribe (quote-and-buy) → WRITE → see `{baseDir}/references/workflows.md` (DCD subscribe flow)
- Early redeem → WRITE → see `{baseDir}/references/workflows.md` (DCD early redeem flow)

For multi-step workflows (idle fund analysis, subscribe + verify, redeem + transfer, on-chain subscribe), read `{baseDir}/references/workflows.md`.

### Step 2 — Confirm write operation

For all WRITE commands, present a summary and wait for explicit confirmation.

> "just do it" / "直接搞" is NOT valid confirmation — the user must see the summary first.

For Simple Earn confirmation dialog format, read `{baseDir}/references/savings-commands.md`. For On-chain confirmation, read `{baseDir}/references/onchain-commands.md`.

### Step 3 — Execute and verify

After any purchase, verify based on product type:
- **DCD** `quote-and-buy` succeeded → run `earn dcd orders --json`, show only the matching order.
- **On-chain** purchase (response contains `ordId`) → run `earn onchain orders --json`, show only the matching order.
- **Simple Earn** purchase (no `ordId` in response) → run `earn savings balance --ccy <ccy> --json`.

**Simple Earn purchase:** Run in parallel — `earn savings balance --ccy <ccy>` and `earn savings rate-history --ccy <ccy> --limit 1 --json`. For output format, read `{baseDir}/references/savings-commands.md`.

**Simple Earn redeem:** Run `earn savings balance --ccy <ccy>` to confirm updated balance. Inform user funds returned to funding account.

**On-chain redeem:** Query `earn onchain orders` to confirm state. Show `estSettlementTime` as estimated arrival time.

**On-chain cancel:** Query `earn onchain orders` after submission:
- Order gone from list → inform user: cancellation complete, funds returned to funding account.
- `state: 3` (cancelling) → inform user: cancellation in progress, funds will return to funding account shortly.

## Global Notes

- **Security:** Never ask users to paste API keys or secrets into chat.
- **Output:** Always pass `--json` to list/query commands and render results as a Markdown table — never paste raw terminal output.
- **Network errors:** If commands fail with a connection error, prompt user to check VPN: `curl -I https://www.okx.com`
- **Language:** Always respond in the user's language.

For number/time formatting and response structure conventions, read `{baseDir}/references/templates.md`.
