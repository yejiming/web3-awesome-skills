# Trailing Stop Runner

> **PREREQUISITE:** Load the following skills to execute this recipe: `kraken-stop-take-profit`, `kraken-spot-execution`

Enter a position and attach a trailing stop to capture trend profits while limiting downside.

## Steps

1. Get current price: `kraken ticker BTCUSD -o json 2>/dev/null`
2. Enter position (requires human approval): `kraken order buy BTCUSD 0.01 --type market -o json 2>/dev/null`
3. Verify fill: `kraken trades-history -o json 2>/dev/null`
4. Set trailing stop (e.g., $500 trail distance): `kraken order sell BTCUSD 0.01 --type trailing-stop --price +500 -o json 2>/dev/null`
5. Verify stop is placed: `kraken open-orders -o json 2>/dev/null`
6. Monitor via stream: `kraken ws ticker BTC/USD -o json 2>/dev/null`
7. When the trailing stop triggers, verify the exit fill: `kraken trades-history -o json 2>/dev/null`
8. Report entry price, exit price, and net P&L
